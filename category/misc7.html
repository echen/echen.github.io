  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of people know that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann Hypothesis</a> has <em>something</em> to do with prime numbers, but most introductions fail to say what or why. I&#8217;ll try to give one angle of explanation.</p>




  <h1>Layman&#8217;s Terms</h1>




  <p>Suppose you have a bunch of friends, each with an instrument that plays at a frequency equal to the imaginary part of a zero of the Riemann zeta function. If the Riemann Hypothesis holds, you can create a song that sounds exactly at the prime-powered beats, by simply telling all your friends to play at the same volume.</p>




  <h1>Mathematical Terms</h1>




  <p>Let $ &#92;pi(x) $ denote the number of primes less than or equal to x. Recall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#The_prime-counting_function_in_terms_of_the_logarithmic_integral">Gauss&#8217;s approximation</a>: $ &#92;pi(x) &#92;approx &#92;int\_2\^x &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log t} &#92;,dt $ (aka, the &#8220;probability that a number n is prime&#8221; is approximately $ &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log n} $).</p>




  <p>Riemann improved on Gauss&#8217;s approximation by discovering an <em>exact</em> formula $ P(x) = A(x) - E(x) $ for counting the primes, where</p>




  <ul>
  <li>$ P(x) = &#92;sum\_{p\^k &lt; x} &#92;frac{1}{k} $ performs a weighted count of the prime powers less than or equal to x. [Think of this as a generalization of the prime counting function.]</li>
  <li>$ A(x) = &#92;int\_0\^x &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log t} &#92;,dt+ &#92;int\_x\^{&#92;infty} &#92;frac{1}{t(t\^2  -1) &#92;log t} &#92;,dt $ $ - &#92;log 2 $ is a kind of generalization of Gauss&#8217;s approximation.</li>
  <li>$ E(x) = &#92;sum\_{z : &#92;zeta(z) = 0} &#92;int\_0\^{x\^z} &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log t} &#92;,dt $ is an error-correcting factor that depends on the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.</li>
  </ul>




  <p>In other words, if we use a simple Gauss-like approximation to the distribution of the primes, the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function sweep up after our errors.</p>




  <p>Let&#8217;s dig a little deeper. Instead of using Riemann&#8217;s formula, I&#8217;m going to use an equivalent version</p>




  <p>$$ &#92;psi(x) = (x + &#92;sum\_{n = 1}\^{&#92;infty} &#92;frac{x\^{-2n}}{2n} - &#92;log 2&#92;pi) - &#92;sum\_{z : &#92;zeta(z) = 0} &#92;frac{x\^z}{z} $$</p>




  <p>where  $ &#92;psi(x) = &#92;sum\_{p\^k &#92;le x} &#92;log p $. Envisioning this formula to be in the same $P(x) = A(x) - E(x)$ form as above, this time where</p>




  <ul>
  <li>$ P(x) = &#92;psi(x) = &#92;sum\_{p\^k &#92;le x} &#92;log p $ is another kind of count of the primes.</li>
  <li>$ A(x) = x + &#92;sum\_{n = 1}\^{&#92;infty} &#92;frac{x\^{-2n}}{2n} - &#92;log 2&#92;pi $ is another kind of approximation to $P(x)$.</li>
  <li>$ E(x) = &#92;sum\_{z : &#92;zeta(z) = 0} &#92;frac{x\^z}{z} $ is another error-correction factor that depends on the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.</li>
  </ul>




  <p>we can again interpret it as an error-correcting formula for counting the primes.</p>




  <p>Now since $ &#92;psi(x) $ is a step function that jumps at the prime powers, its derivative $ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) $ has spikes at the prime powers and is zero everywhere else. So consider</p>




  <p>$$ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) = 1 - &#92;frac{1}{x(x\^2 - 1)} - &#92;sum\_z x\^{z-1} $$</p>




  <p>It&#8217;s well-known that the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function are symmetric about the real axis, so the (non-trivial) zeroes come in conjugate pairs $ z, &#92;bar{z} $. But $ x\^{z-1} + x\^{&#92;bar{z} - 1} $ is just a wave whose amplitude depends on the real part of z and whose frequency depends on the imaginary part (i.e., if $ z = a + bi $, then $ x\^{z-1} + x\^{&#92;bar{z}-1} = 2x\^{a-1} cos (b &#92;log x) $), which means $ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) $ can be decomposed into a sum of zeta-zero waves. Note that because of the $2x\^{a-1}$ term in front, the amplitude of these waves depends only on the real part $a$ of the conjugate zeroes.</p>




  <p>For example, here are plots of $ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) $ using 10, 50, and 200 pairs of zeroes:</p>




  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/10.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/10.png" alt="10 Pairs" /></a></p>




  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/50.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/50.png" alt="50 Pairs" /></a></p>




  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/200.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/200.png" alt="50 Pairs" /></a></p>




  <p>So when the Riemann Hypothesis says that all the non-trivial zeroes have real part 1/2, it&#8217;s hypothesizing that the non-trivial zeta-zero waves have equal amplitude, i.e., they make equal contributions to counting the primes.</p>




  <p><strong>In Fourier-poetic terms</strong>, when Flying Spaghetti Monster composed the music of the primes, he built the notes out of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. If the Riemann Hypothesis holds, he made all the non-trivial notes equally loud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant approach to the Evasiveness Conjecture (see the original paper <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/index/R521072311641L41.pdf">here</a>) is an epic application of pure mathematics to computer science. I&#8217;ll give an overview of the approach here, and probably try to add some more information on the problem in other posts.</p>

  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> The KSS approach provides an algebraic-topological attack to a combinatorial hypothesis, and reduces a graph complexity problem to a problem of contractibility and (not) finding fixed points.</p>

  <p>First, the Evasiveness Conjecture states that any (non-trivial) monotone graph property is evasive. In other words, if you&#8217;re trying to figure out whether an undirected n-vertex graph satisfies a certain property (e.g., whether the graph contains a triangle or is connected), and this property is monotone (meaning that if you add more edges to the graph, then it still satisfies the property), then if all you&#8217;re allowed to do is ask questions of the form &#8220;Is edge (i, j) in the graph?&#8221;, then you need to query for every single edge before you can determine whether the graph satisfies the property or not. For example, if you want to figure out whether a graph G contains a clique of size 5, then you need to know whether each of the n(n-1)/2 possible edges is in the graph or not before you can answer for certain.</p>

  <p>Next, given any monotone graph property on n-vertex graphs, we can associate it with a simplicial complex S (basically, an n-dimensional structure formed by gluing together a bunch of hypertriangles), by taking the complex to be the set of all n-vertex graphs that don&#8217;t satisfy the property.</p>

  <p>Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant then prove that if a monotone graph property is not evasive, then its associated simplicial complex is contractible, and thus (by the Lefschetz Fixed-Point theorem) any auto-simplicial map on the complex (a function from the complex to itself that preserves faces) has a fixed point.</p>

  <p>Thus, we can prove that a monotone graph property is evasive by finding a simplicial map that has no fixed point (which we can do by showing that no orbit of the map is a face of the complex). This approach has been used to prove things like the evasiveness of graph properties when the number of vertices is prime or a prime power, and the evasiveness of all bipartite graph properties.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In making its product recommendations, Amazon makes heavy use of an item-to-item collaborative filtering approach. This essentially means that for each item X, Amazon builds a neighborhood of related items S(X); whenever you buy/look at an item, Amazon then recommends you items from that item&#8217;s neighborhood. That&#8217;s why when you sign in to Amazon and look at the front page, your recommendations are mostly of the form &#8220;You viewed&#8230; Customers who viewed this also viewed&#8230;&#8221;.</p>

<h1>Other approaches.</h1>

<p>The item-to-item approach can be contrasted to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A user-to-user collaborative filtering approach</strong>. This finds users similar to you (e.g., it could find users who bought a lot of items in common with you), and suggest items that they&#8217;ve bought but you haven&#8217;t.</li>
<li><strong>A global, latent factorization approach</strong>. Rather than looking at individual items in isolation (in the item-to-item approach, if you and I both buy a book X, Amazon will make essentially the same recommendations based on X, regardless of what we&#8217;ve bought in the past), a global approach would look at all the items you&#8217;ve bought, and try to detect properties that characterize what you like. For example, if you buy a lot of science fiction books and also a lot of romance books, a global-approach algorithm might try to recommend you books with both science fiction and romance elements.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Pros/cons of the item-to-item approach:</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros over the user-to-user approach</strong>: Amazon (and most applications) has many more users than items, so it&#8217;s computationally simpler to find similar items than it is to find similar users. Finding similar users is also a difficult algorithmic task, since individual users often have a very wide range of tastes, but individual items usually belong to relatively few genres.</li>
<li><strong>Pros over the factorization approach</strong>: Simpler to implement. Faster to update recommendations: as soon as you buy a new book, Amazon can make a new recommendation in the item-to-item approach, whereas a factorization approach would have to wait until the factorization has been recomputed. The item-to-item approach can also be more easily leveraged in several areas, not only in the recommendations made to you, but also in the &#8220;similar items/other customers also bought&#8221; section when you look at a particular item.</li>
<li><strong>Cons of the item-to-item approach</strong>: You don&#8217;t get very much diversity or surprise in item-to-item recommendations, so recommendations tend to be kind of &#8220;obvious&#8221; and boring.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to find similar items</h1>

<p>Since the item-to-item approach makes crucial use of similar items, here&#8217;s a high-level view of how to do it. First, associate each item with the set of users who have bought/looked at it. The similarity between any two items could then be a normalized measure of the number of users they have in common (i.e., the Jaccard index) or the cosine distance between the two items (imagine each item as a vector, with a 1 in the ith element if user i has bought it, and 0 otherwise).</p>
