  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Way back when, I went through all the Netflix prize papers. I&#8217;m now (very slowly) trying to clean up my notes and put them online. Eventually, I hope to have a more integrated tutorial, but here&#8217;s a rough draft for now.)</p>

  <p>This is a summary of Koren&#8217;s 2008 <a href="public.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/kdd08koren.pdf">Factorization Meets the Neighborhood: a Multifaceted Collaborative Filtering Model</a>.</p>

  <p>There are two approaches to collaborative filtering: neighborhood methods and latent factor models.</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Neighborhood models are most effective at detecting very localized relationships (e.g., that people who like X-Men also like Spiderman), but poor at detecting a user&#8217;s overall signals.</li>
  <li>Latent factor models are best at estimating overall structure (e.g., that a user likes horror movies), but are poor at detecting strong associations among small sets of closely related items.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Since the two approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, we should integrate the two; this integration is the focus of this paper.</p>

  <h1>Preliminaries</h1>

  <p>As mentioned in previous papers, we should normalize out common effects from movies. Throughout the rest of this paper, Koren uses a baseline estimate of overall rating mean + user deviation from average + movie deviation from average for the rating of user i on movie i; estimation of the latter two parameters are done by solving a regularized least squares problem.</p>

  <p>Koren then describes using a binary matrix (1 for rated, 0 for not rated) as a source of implicit feedback. This is useful because the mere fact that a user rated many science fiction movies (say) suggests that the user likes science fiction movies.</p>

  <h1>A Neighborhood Model</h1>

  <p>Recall the previous paper, where we modeled each rating $r_{ui}$ as</p>

  <p>$$r_{ui} = b_{ui}+ \sum_{N \in N(i; u)} (r_{uj} - b_{uj}) w_{ij},$$</p>

  <p>where $N(i; u)$ is the k items most similar to i among the items user u rated, and the $w_{ij}$ are parameters to be learned by solving a regularized least squares problem.</p>

  <p>This paper makes several enhancements to that model. First, we replace $N(i; u)$ with $R^k(i; u)$, the intersection of the k items most similar to i (among all items) intersected with the items user u rated. Also, we denote by $N^k(i; u)$ the intersection of the k items most similar to i with the items user u has provided implicit feedback for. This gives us</p>

  <p>$$r_{ui} = b_{ui} + \sum_{j \in R^k(i; u)} (r_{uj} - b_{uj}) w_{ij} + \sum_{j \in N^k(i; u)} c_{ij},$$</p>

  <p>where the $c_{ij}$ are another set of parameters to learn.</p>

  <p>Notice that by taking the intersection of the k items most similar to i with the items user u rated (giving perhaps a set of size less than k), rather than taking the k items most similar to i among the items user u rated, we let our model be influenced not only by what a user rates, but also by what a user does not rate. For example, if a user does not rate LOTR 1 or LOTR 2, his predicted rating for LOTR 3 is penalized.</p>

  <p>This implies that our current model encourages greater deviations from baseline estimates for users that provided many ratings or plenty of implicit feedback. In other words, for well-modeled users with a lot of input, we are willing to predict quirkier and less common recommendations; users we have less information about, on the other hand, receive safer, baseline estimates.</p>

  <p>Nonetheless, this dichotomy between power users and newbie users is perhaps overemphasized by our current model, so we moderate the dichotomy by modifying our model to be</p>

  <p>$$r_{ui} = b_{ui} + |R^k(i; u)|^{-0.5} \sum_{j \in R^k(i; u)} (r_{uj} - b_{uj}) w_{ij} + |N^k(i; u)|^{-0.5} \sum_{j \in N^k(i; u)} c_{ij}.$$</p>

  <p>Parameters are determined by solving a regularized least squares problem.</p>

  <h1>Latent Factor Models Revisited</h1>

  <p>Typical SVD approaches are based on the following rule:</p>

  <p>$$r_{ui} = b_{ui} + p_u^T q_i,$$</p>

  <p>where $p_u$ is a user-factors vector and $q_i$ is an item-factors vector. We describe two enhancements.</p>

  <h2>Asymmetric-SVD</h2>

  <p>One suggestion is to replace $p_u$ with</p>

  <p>$$|R(u)|^{-0.5} + \sum_{j \in R(u)} (r_{uj} - b_{uj}) x_j + |N(u)|^{-0.5} \sum_{j \in N(u)} y_j,$$</p>

  <p>where $R(u)$ is the set of items user u has rated, and $N(u)$ is the set of items user u has provided implicit feedback for. In other words, this model represents users through the items they prefer, rather than expressing users in a latent feature space. This model has several advantages:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Asymmetric-SVD does not parameterize users, so we do not need to wait to retrain the model when a user comes in. Instead, we can handle new users as soon as they provide feedback.</li>
  <li>Predictions are a direct function of past feedback, so we can easily explain predictions. (When using a pure latent feature solution, however, explainability is difficult.)</li>
  </ul>


  <p>As usual, parameters are learned via a regularized least-squares minimization.</p>

  <h2>SVD++</h2>

  <p>Another approach is to continue modeling users as latent features, while adding implicit feedback. Thus, we replace $p_u$ with $p_u + |N(u)|^{-0.5} \sum_{j \in N(u)} y_j$. While we lose the easily explainability and immediate feedback of the Asymmetric-SVD model, this approach is likely more accurate.</p>

  <h1>An Integrated Model</h1>

  <p>An integrated model incorporating baseline estimates, the neighborhood approach, and the latent factor approach is as follows:</p>

  <p>$$r_{ui} = \left[\mu + b_u + b_i\right] +\left[q_i^T \big(p_u + \sqrt{|N(u)|}\sum_{j \in N(u)} y_j \big)\right] + \left[\sqrt{|R^k(i;u)} \sum_{j \in R^k(i; u)}(r_{uj} - b_{uj})w_{ij}+\sqrt{|N^k(i;u)|} \sum_{j \in N^k(i; u)} c_{ij}\right].$$</p>

  <p>Note that we have used $(\mu + b_u + b_i)$ as our baseline estimate. We also used the SVD++ model, but we could use the Asymmetric-SVD model instead.</p>

  <p>This rule provides a 3-tier model for recommendations:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>The first baseline group describes general properties of the item and user. For example, it may say that &#8220;The Sixth Sense&#8221; movie is known to be a good movie in general, and that Joe rates like the average user.</li>
  <li>The next latent factor group may say that since &#8220;The Sixth Sense&#8221; and Joe rate high on the Psychological Thrillers Scale, Joe may like The Sixth Sense because he likes this genre of movies in general.</li>
  <li>The final neighborhood tier makes fine-grained adjustments that are hard to file, such as the fact that Joe rated low the movie &#8220;Signs&#8221;, a similar psychological thriller by the same director.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>As usual, model parameters are determined by minimizing the regularized squared error function through gradient descent.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(Way back when, I went through all the Netflix prize papers. I&#8217;m now (very slowly) trying to clean up my notes and put them online. Eventually, I hope to have a more integrated tutorial, but here&#8217;s a rough draft for now.)</p>

  <p>This is a summary of Bell and Koren&#8217;s 2007 <a href="public.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/BellKorICDM07.pdf">Scalable Collaborative Filtering with Jointly Derived Neighborhood Interpolation Weights</a> paper.</p>

  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> This paper&#8217;s main innovation is deriving neighborhood weights by solving a least squares problem, instead of using a standard similarity function to compute weights.</p>

  <p>This paper improves upon the standard neighborhood approach to collaborative filtering in three areas: better data normalization, better neighbor weights (this is the key section), and better use of user data. I&#8217;ll first review the standard neighborhood approach, and follow with a description of these enhancements.</p>

  <h2>Background: Standard Neighborhood Approach to Collaborative Filtering</h2>

  <p>Recall that there are two types of neighborhood approaches:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>User-based approaches: to predict user i&#8217;s rating of item j, take the users most similar to user i, and perform a weighted average of their ratings of item j.</li>
  <li>Item-based approaches: to predict user i&#8217;s rating of item j, perform a weighted average of user i&#8217;s ratings of items similar to item j.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>For example, to predict how you would rate the first Harry Potter movie, the user-based approach looks at how your friends rated the first Harry Potter movie, while the item-based approach looks at how you rated movies like Lord of the Rings and Twilight.</p>

  <h2>Better Data Normalization</h2>

  <p>Suppose I ask my friend Chris whether I should watch the latest Twilight movie. He tells me he would rate it 4.0/5 stars. Great, that&#8217;s a high rating, so that means I should watch it &#8211; or does it? It turns out that Chris is a super cheerful guy who&#8217;s never met a movie he didn&#8217;t like, and his average rating for a movie is actually 4.5/5 stars. So Twilight is actually less than average for him, and hence 4.0/5 stars from Chris isn&#8217;t actually that hearty a recommendation.</p>

  <p>As another example, suppose you look at doctor ratings on Yelp. They&#8217;re abnormally high: the average is far from 3/5 stars. Why is this? Maybe it&#8217;s harder for people to change doctors than it is to go to a new restaurant, so people might not want to rate a doctor poorly when they know they&#8217;ll have to see the doctor again. Thus, an average rating of 5 stars on a McDonalds restaurant is much more impressive than an average of 5 stars on Dr. Joe.</p>

  <p>The lesson is that when using existing ratings, we should normalize out these types of effects, so that ratings are as comparable as possible.</p>

  <p>Another way of thinking about this is that we are simply building a regression model. That is, for each user u, we have a model
  $r_{ui} = (\sum \theta_u x_{ui}) + SpecificRating$, where the $x_{ui}$ are common explanatory variables and we want to estimate $\theta_u$; and similarly for each item i. Once we&#8217;ve estimated the $\theta_u$, we can use the fancier neighborhood models on the specific ratings.</p>

  <p>For example, suppose we want to predict Bob&#8217;s rating of Titanic. We&#8217;ve built a regression model with two explanatory variables, whether the movie was Oscar-nominated (1 if so, -1 if not) and whether the movie contains Kate Winslet (1 if so, -1 if not), and we&#8217;ve determined that Bob&#8217;s weights on these two variables are -2 (Bob tends to hate Oscar movies) and +1.5 (Bob likes Kate Winslet). Similarly, his friend John has weights +1 and -0.5 for these two variables (John likes Oscars, but dislikes Kate Winslet). So if we know that John rated Titanic a 4, then we have 4 = 1(1) + -0.5(1) + (John&#8217;s specific rating), so John&#8217;s specific rating of Titanic is 3.5. If we use John&#8217;s rating alone to estimate Bob&#8217;s, we might guess that Bob would rate Titanic -2(1) + 1.5(1) + (John&#8217;s specific rating) = 3.0.</p>

  <p>To estimate the $\theta_u$, we actually perform this estimation in sequence: each explanatory variable is used to model the <em>residual</em> from the previous explanatory variable. Also, instead of using the maximum-likelihood unbiased estimator $\hat{\theta_u} = \frac{\sum r_{ui} x_{ui}}{x _ {ui} ^ 2}$, we shrink the weights to prevent overfitting. From a Bayesian point of view, the shrinkage arises from a hierarchical model where the true $\theta_u \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$, and $\hat{\theta_u} | \theta_u \sim N(\theta_u, \sigma_u^2)$, leading to $E(\theta_u | \hat{\theta_u}) = \frac{\sigma^2 \hat{\theta_u} + \sigma_u^2 \mu}{\sigma^2 + \sigma_u^2}$.</p>

  <p>In practice, the explanatory variables Bell and Koren found to work well included the overall mean of all ratings, each movie&#8217;s specific mean, each user&#8217;s specific mean, time since movie release, time since user join, and number of ratings for each movie.</p>

  <h2>Better Neighbor Weights</h2>

  <p>Let&#8217;s consider some deficiencies of the neighborhood approach:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Suppose I want to use the first LOTR movie to predict ratings of the first Harry Potter movie. To do this, I need to say how much weight the first LOTR movie should have in this prediction. But how do I choose this weight? Standard neighborhood approaches essentially pick arbitrary similarity functions (e.g., Pearson correlation, cosine distance) as the weight, possibly testing several similarity functions to see which gives the best performance, but is there a more principled approach to choosing weights?</li>
  <li>The standard neighborhood approach ignores the fact that neighbors aren&#8217;t independent. For example, suppose all three LOTR movies are neighbors of the first HP movie. Since the three LOTR movies are so similar to each other, the standard approach is overcounting their information. Here&#8217;s an analogy: suppose I ask five of my friends where I should eat tonight. Three of them live together (boyfriend, girlfriend, and roommate), and they all recently took a trip together to Japan and are sick of Japanese food, so they vehemently recommend against sushi. Thus, my friends&#8217; recommendations have a stronger bias than would appear if I asked five friends who didn&#8217;t know each other at all.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>We&#8217;ll see how using an optimization method to derive weights (as opposed to deriving weights via a similarity function) overcomes these two limitations.</p>

  <p>Recall our problem: we want to predict $r_{ui}$, user u&#8217;s rating of item i, and what we have is a set $N(i; u)$ of K neighbors of item i that user u has also rated. (These K neighbors are selected via a similarity function, as is standard.) So what we want to do is find weights $w_{ij}$ such that $r_{ui} = \sum_{j \in N(i; u) w_{ij} r_{uj}}$. A natural approach, then, is simply to choose our weights to minimize $\min_w \sum_{v \neq u} \left( r_{vi} - \sum_{j \in N(i; u)} w_{ij} r_{vj}\right)^2$.</p>

  <p>Notice how this optimization solves our two problems above: it&#8217;s not only a more principled approach (we choose our weights by minimizing squared error), but by deriving weights simultaneously, we overcome interaction effects.</p>

  <p>Differentiating our cost function, we find that the optimal weights satisfy the equation $Aw = b$, where A is a $K \times K$ matrix defined by $A_{jk} = \sum_{v \neq u} r_{vj} r_{vk}$ and $b$ is a vector defined by $b_j = \sum_{v \neq u} r_{vj} r_{vi}$.</p>

  <p>However, not all users have rated every movie, so some of the ratings may be missing from the above formulas. So we should instead use an estimate of A and b, such as $\bar{A}_{jk} = \frac{\sum_{v \in U(j,k)} r_{vj} r_{vk}}{|U(j, k)|}$, where $U(j, k)$ is the set of users who rated both j and k, and similarly for b. To avoid overfitting, we should further modify by shrinking to a common mean: $\hat{A}_{jk} = \frac{|U(J,K)|\bar{A}_{jk} + \beta A_{\mu}}{|U(j,k)| + \beta}$, where $\beta$ is a shrinkage parameter and $A_{\mu}$ is the mean over all $\bar{A}$, and similarly for b.</p>

  <p>Note that another benefit of our optimization-derived weights is that the weights of neighbors are no longer constrained to sum to 1. Thus, if an item simply has no strong neighbors, the neighbors&#8217; prediction will have only a small effect.</p>

  <p>Also, when engineering these methods in practice, we should precompute all item-item similarities and all entries in the matrix $A$.</p>

  <h2>Better Use of User Data</h2>

  <p>Neighborhood models typically follow the item-based approach for two reasons:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>There are typically many more users than items, and new users come in much more frequently than new items, so it is easier to compute all pairs of item-item similarities.</li>
  <li>Users have diverse tastes, so they aren&#8217;t as similar to each other. For example, Alice and Eve may both like horror movies, but disagree on comedies.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>But there are various reasons we might want to use a user-based approach <em>in addition to</em> an item-based approach (say, a user hasn&#8217;t rated many items yet, but we can find similar users based on other types of data, such as browsing history; or, we want to predict user u&#8217;s rating on item i, but user u hasn&#8217;t rated any items similar to i), so let&#8217;s see if we can get around these limitations.</p>

  <p>To get around the first limitation, we can project users into a lower-dimensional space (say, by using a singular value decomposition), where we can use a space-partitioning data structure (e.g., a kd-tree) or a nearest-neighbor algorithm (e.g., locality sensitive hashing) to find neighboring users.</p>

  <p>To get around the second limitation &#8211; that a user u may be predictive of user v for some items, but less so for others &#8211; we incorporate item-item similarity into our weighting method. That is, when using the user-neighborhood model to predict user u&#8217;s rating on item i, we give higher weight to items similar to i, by choosing the weights to minimize $\min_w \sum_{j \neq i} s_{ij} \left( r_{uj} - \sum_{v \in N(u, i)} w_{uv} r_{vj} \right)^2,$ where the $s_{ij}$ are item-item similarities.</p>

  <h2>Appendix: Shrinkage</h2>

  <p>Parameter shrinkage is used a couple times in the paper, so let&#8217;s explain what it means.</p>

  <p>Suppose that we want to estimate the probability of a coin. If we flip it once and see heads, then the maximum-likelihood estimate of heads is 1. But (as is typical for maximum-likelihood estimates), this is severe overfitting, and what we should do instead is shrink this maximum-likelihood estimate to a prior estimate of the probability of heads, say 1/2. (Note that shrinkage doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean decreasing the number, just moving it towards a prior estimate).</p>

  <p>How should we perform this shrinkage? If our maximum-likelihood estimate of our parameter $\theta$ is $x$ and our prior mean is $\mu$, a natural estimation of $\theta$ is to use a weighted mean $\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)\mu$, where $\alpha$ is some measure of the degree of belief in our maximum likelihood estimate.</p>

  <p>This weighted average approach has several interpretations:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>We can also view it as a shrinkage of our maximum likelihood estimate to our prior mean: $\alpha x + (1 - \alpha)\mu = x + (1 - \alpha) (\mu - x)$</li>
  <li>We can also view it as a Bayesian posterior: if we use a prior $\theta \sim N(\mu, \tau)$ (where $\tau$ is the precision of our Gaussian, not the variance) and a conditional distribution $x | \theta \sim N(\theta, \tau_x)$, then the posterior mean of $\theta$ is $\theta = \frac{\tau_x}{\tau_x + \tau}x + \frac{\tau}{\tau_x + \tau}\mu,$ which is equivalent to the form above.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lots of people know that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis">Riemann Hypothesis</a> has <em>something</em> to do with prime numbers, but most introductions fail to say what or why. I&#8217;ll try to give one angle of explanation.</p>




  <h1>Layman&#8217;s Terms</h1>




  <p>Suppose you have a bunch of friends, each with an instrument that plays at a frequency equal to the imaginary part of a zero of the Riemann zeta function. If the Riemann Hypothesis holds, you can create a song that sounds exactly at the prime-powered beats, by simply telling all your friends to play at the same volume.</p>




  <h1>Mathematical Terms</h1>




  <p>Let $ &#92;pi(x) $ denote the number of primes less than or equal to x. Recall <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem#The_prime-counting_function_in_terms_of_the_logarithmic_integral">Gauss&#8217;s approximation</a>: $ &#92;pi(x) &#92;approx &#92;int\_2\^x &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log t} &#92;,dt $ (aka, the &#8220;probability that a number n is prime&#8221; is approximately $ &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log n} $).</p>




  <p>Riemann improved on Gauss&#8217;s approximation by discovering an <em>exact</em> formula $ P(x) = A(x) - E(x) $ for counting the primes, where</p>




  <ul>
  <li>$ P(x) = &#92;sum\_{p\^k &lt; x} &#92;frac{1}{k} $ performs a weighted count of the prime powers less than or equal to x. [Think of this as a generalization of the prime counting function.]</li>
  <li>$ A(x) = &#92;int\_0\^x &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log t} &#92;,dt+ &#92;int\_x\^{&#92;infty} &#92;frac{1}{t(t\^2  -1) &#92;log t} &#92;,dt $ $ - &#92;log 2 $ is a kind of generalization of Gauss&#8217;s approximation.</li>
  <li>$ E(x) = &#92;sum\_{z : &#92;zeta(z) = 0} &#92;int\_0\^{x\^z} &#92;frac{1}{&#92;log t} &#92;,dt $ is an error-correcting factor that depends on the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.</li>
  </ul>




  <p>In other words, if we use a simple Gauss-like approximation to the distribution of the primes, the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function sweep up after our errors.</p>




  <p>Let&#8217;s dig a little deeper. Instead of using Riemann&#8217;s formula, I&#8217;m going to use an equivalent version</p>




  <p>$$ &#92;psi(x) = (x + &#92;sum\_{n = 1}\^{&#92;infty} &#92;frac{x\^{-2n}}{2n} - &#92;log 2&#92;pi) - &#92;sum\_{z : &#92;zeta(z) = 0} &#92;frac{x\^z}{z} $$</p>




  <p>where  $ &#92;psi(x) = &#92;sum\_{p\^k &#92;le x} &#92;log p $. Envisioning this formula to be in the same $P(x) = A(x) - E(x)$ form as above, this time where</p>




  <ul>
  <li>$ P(x) = &#92;psi(x) = &#92;sum\_{p\^k &#92;le x} &#92;log p $ is another kind of count of the primes.</li>
  <li>$ A(x) = x + &#92;sum\_{n = 1}\^{&#92;infty} &#92;frac{x\^{-2n}}{2n} - &#92;log 2&#92;pi $ is another kind of approximation to $P(x)$.</li>
  <li>$ E(x) = &#92;sum\_{z : &#92;zeta(z) = 0} &#92;frac{x\^z}{z} $ is another error-correction factor that depends on the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function.</li>
  </ul>




  <p>we can again interpret it as an error-correcting formula for counting the primes.</p>




  <p>Now since $ &#92;psi(x) $ is a step function that jumps at the prime powers, its derivative $ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) $ has spikes at the prime powers and is zero everywhere else. So consider</p>




  <p>$$ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) = 1 - &#92;frac{1}{x(x\^2 - 1)} - &#92;sum\_z x\^{z-1} $$</p>




  <p>It&#8217;s well-known that the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function are symmetric about the real axis, so the (non-trivial) zeroes come in conjugate pairs $ z, &#92;bar{z} $. But $ x\^{z-1} + x\^{&#92;bar{z} - 1} $ is just a wave whose amplitude depends on the real part of z and whose frequency depends on the imaginary part (i.e., if $ z = a + bi $, then $ x\^{z-1} + x\^{&#92;bar{z}-1} = 2x\^{a-1} cos (b &#92;log x) $), which means $ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) $ can be decomposed into a sum of zeta-zero waves. Note that because of the $2x\^{a-1}$ term in front, the amplitude of these waves depends only on the real part $a$ of the conjugate zeroes.</p>




  <p>For example, here are plots of $ &#92;psi&#8217;(x) $ using 10, 50, and 200 pairs of zeroes:</p>




  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/10.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/10.png" alt="10 Pairs" /></a></p>




  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/50.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/50.png" alt="50 Pairs" /></a></p>




  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/200.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/riemann-hypothesis/200.png" alt="50 Pairs" /></a></p>




  <p>So when the Riemann Hypothesis says that all the non-trivial zeroes have real part 1/2, it&#8217;s hypothesizing that the non-trivial zeta-zero waves have equal amplitude, i.e., they make equal contributions to counting the primes.</p>




  <p><strong>In Fourier-poetic terms</strong>, when Flying Spaghetti Monster composed the music of the primes, he built the notes out of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. If the Riemann Hypothesis holds, he made all the non-trivial notes equally loud.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant approach to the Evasiveness Conjecture (see the original paper <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/index/R521072311641L41.pdf">here</a>) is an epic application of pure mathematics to computer science. I&#8217;ll give an overview of the approach here, and probably try to add some more information on the problem in other posts.</p>

  <p><strong>tl;dr</strong> The KSS approach provides an algebraic-topological attack to a combinatorial hypothesis, and reduces a graph complexity problem to a problem of contractibility and (not) finding fixed points.</p>

  <p>First, the Evasiveness Conjecture states that any (non-trivial) monotone graph property is evasive. In other words, if you&#8217;re trying to figure out whether an undirected n-vertex graph satisfies a certain property (e.g., whether the graph contains a triangle or is connected), and this property is monotone (meaning that if you add more edges to the graph, then it still satisfies the property), then if all you&#8217;re allowed to do is ask questions of the form &#8220;Is edge (i, j) in the graph?&#8221;, then you need to query for every single edge before you can determine whether the graph satisfies the property or not. For example, if you want to figure out whether a graph G contains a clique of size 5, then you need to know whether each of the n(n-1)/2 possible edges is in the graph or not before you can answer for certain.</p>

  <p>Next, given any monotone graph property on n-vertex graphs, we can associate it with a simplicial complex S (basically, an n-dimensional structure formed by gluing together a bunch of hypertriangles), by taking the complex to be the set of all n-vertex graphs that don&#8217;t satisfy the property.</p>

  <p>Kahn, Saks, and Sturtevant then prove that if a monotone graph property is not evasive, then its associated simplicial complex is contractible, and thus (by the Lefschetz Fixed-Point theorem) any auto-simplicial map on the complex (a function from the complex to itself that preserves faces) has a fixed point.</p>

  <p>Thus, we can prove that a monotone graph property is evasive by finding a simplicial map that has no fixed point (which we can do by showing that no orbit of the map is a face of the complex). This approach has been used to prove things like the evasiveness of graph properties when the number of vertices is prime or a prime power, and the evasiveness of all bipartite graph properties.</p>

<div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In making its product recommendations, Amazon makes heavy use of an item-to-item collaborative filtering approach. This essentially means that for each item X, Amazon builds a neighborhood of related items S(X); whenever you buy/look at an item, Amazon then recommends you items from that item&#8217;s neighborhood. That&#8217;s why when you sign in to Amazon and look at the front page, your recommendations are mostly of the form &#8220;You viewed&#8230; Customers who viewed this also viewed&#8230;&#8221;.</p>

<h1>Other approaches.</h1>

<p>The item-to-item approach can be contrasted to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A user-to-user collaborative filtering approach</strong>. This finds users similar to you (e.g., it could find users who bought a lot of items in common with you), and suggest items that they&#8217;ve bought but you haven&#8217;t.</li>
<li><strong>A global, latent factorization approach</strong>. Rather than looking at individual items in isolation (in the item-to-item approach, if you and I both buy a book X, Amazon will make essentially the same recommendations based on X, regardless of what we&#8217;ve bought in the past), a global approach would look at all the items you&#8217;ve bought, and try to detect properties that characterize what you like. For example, if you buy a lot of science fiction books and also a lot of romance books, a global-approach algorithm might try to recommend you books with both science fiction and romance elements.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Pros/cons of the item-to-item approach:</h1>

<ul>
<li><strong>Pros over the user-to-user approach</strong>: Amazon (and most applications) has many more users than items, so it&#8217;s computationally simpler to find similar items than it is to find similar users. Finding similar users is also a difficult algorithmic task, since individual users often have a very wide range of tastes, but individual items usually belong to relatively few genres.</li>
<li><strong>Pros over the factorization approach</strong>: Simpler to implement. Faster to update recommendations: as soon as you buy a new book, Amazon can make a new recommendation in the item-to-item approach, whereas a factorization approach would have to wait until the factorization has been recomputed. The item-to-item approach can also be more easily leveraged in several areas, not only in the recommendations made to you, but also in the &#8220;similar items/other customers also bought&#8221; section when you look at a particular item.</li>
<li><strong>Cons of the item-to-item approach</strong>: You don&#8217;t get very much diversity or surprise in item-to-item recommendations, so recommendations tend to be kind of &#8220;obvious&#8221; and boring.</li>
</ul>


<h1>How to find similar items</h1>

<p>Since the item-to-item approach makes crucial use of similar items, here&#8217;s a high-level view of how to do it. First, associate each item with the set of users who have bought/looked at it. The similarity between any two items could then be a normalized measure of the number of users they have in common (i.e., the Jaccard index) or the cosine distance between the two items (imagine each item as a vector, with a 1 in the ith element if user i has bought it, and 0 otherwise).</p>
