  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> is an online crowdfunding platform for launching creative projects. When starting a new project, project owners specify a deadline and the minimum amount of money they need to raise. They receive the money (less a transaction fee) only if they reach or exceed that minimum; otherwise, no money changes hands.</p>

  <p>What&#8217;s particularly fun about Kickstarter is that in contrast to <a href="http://www.kiva.org/">that other microfinance site</a>, Kickstarter projects don&#8217;t ask for loans; instead, patrons receive pre-specified rewards unique to each project. For example, someone donating money to help an artist record an album might receive a digital copy of the album if they donate 20 dollars, or a digital copy plus a signed physical cd if they donate 50 dollars.</p>

  <p>There are <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/hall-of-fame?ref=sidebar">a bunch</a> of <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1104350651/tiktok-lunatik-multi-touch-watch-kits">neat</a> <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2024077040/neil-gaimans-the-price">projects</a>, and I&#8217;m tempted to put one of my own on there soon, so I thought it would be fun to gather some data from the site and see what makes a project successful.</p>

  <h1>Categories</h1>

  <p>I started by scraping the categories section.</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/successful-projects-by-category.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/successful-projects-by-category.png" alt="Successful projects by category" /></a></p>

  <p>In true indie fashion, the artsy categories tend to dominate. (I&#8217;m surprised/disappointed how little love the Technology category gets.)</p>

  <h1>Ending Soon</h1>

  <p>The categories section really only provides a history of <em>successful</em> projects, though, so to get some data on unsuccessful projects as well, I took a look at the <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/discover/ending-soon?ref=sidebar">Ending Soon</a> section of projects whose deadlines are about to pass.</p>

  <p>It looks like about 50% of all Kickstarter projects get successfully funded by the deadline:</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/ending-soon-success.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/ending-soon-success.png" alt="Successful projects as deadline approaches" /></a></p>

  <p>Interestingly, most of the final funding seems to happen in the final few days: with just 5 days left, only about 20% of all projects have been funded. (In other words, with just 5 days left, 60% of the projects that will eventually be successful are still unfunded.) So the approaching deadline seems to really spur people to donate. I wonder if it&#8217;s because of increased publicity in the final few days (the project owners begging everyone for help!) or if it&#8217;s simply procrastination in action (perhaps people want to wait to see if their donation is really necessary)?</p>

  <p>Lesson: if you&#8217;re still not fully funded with only a couple days remaining, don&#8217;t despair.</p>

  <h1>Success vs. Failure</h1>

  <p>What factors lead a project to succeed? Are there any quantitative differences between projects that eventually get funded and those that don&#8217;t?</p>

  <p>Two simple (if kind of obvious) things I noticed are that unsuccessful projects tend to require a larger amount of money:</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/successful-vs-unsuccessful-goal.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/successful-vs-unsuccessful-goal.png" alt="Unsuccessful projects tend to ask for more money" /></a></p>

  <p>and unsuccessful projects also tend to raise less money in absolute terms (i.e., it&#8217;s not just that they ask for too much money to reach their goal &#8211; they&#8217;re simply not receiving enough money as well):</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/successful-vs-unsuccessful-amount-pledged.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/successful-vs-unsuccessful-amount-pledged.png" alt="Unsuccessful projects received less money" /></a></p>

  <p>Not terribly surprising, but it&#8217;s good to confirm (and I&#8217;m still working on finding other predictors).</p>

  <h1>Pledge Rewards</h1>

  <p>There&#8217;s a lot of interesting work in behavioral economics on pricing and choice &#8211; for example, the <a href="http://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/07/27/anchoring-effect/">anchoring effect</a> suggests that when building a menu, you should <a href="http://www.neurosciencemarketing.com/blog/articles/neuro-menus-and-restaurant-psychology.htm">include an expensive item</a> to make other menu items look reasonably priced in comparison, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paradox_of_Choice:_Why_More_Is_Less">paradox of choice </a> suggests that too many choices lead to a decision freeze &#8211; so one aspect of the Kickstarter data I was especially interested in was how pricing of rewards affects donations. For example, does pricing the lowest reward at 25 dollars lead to more money donated (people don&#8217;t lowball at 5 dollars instead) or less money donated (25 dollars is more money than most people are willing to give)? And what happens if a new reward at 5 dollars is added &#8211; again, does it lead to more money (now people can donate something they can afford) or less money (the people that would have paid 25 dollars switch to a 5 dollar donation)?</p>

  <p>First, here&#8217;s a look at the total number of pledges at each price. (More accurately, it&#8217;s the number of claimed rewards at each price.) [Update: the original version of this graph was wrong, but I&#8217;ve since fixed it.]</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/pledge%20amounts.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/pledge%20amounts.png" alt="Pledge Amounts" /></a></p>

  <p>Surprisingly, 5 dollar and 1 dollar donations are actually not the most common contribution.</p>

  <p>To investigate pricing effects, I started by looking at all (successful) projects that had a reward priced at 1 dollar, and compared the number of donations at 1 dollar with the number of donations at the next lowest reward.</p>

  <p>Up to about 15-20 dollars, there&#8217;s a steady increase in the proportion of people who choose the second reward over the first reward, but after that, the proportion decreases.</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/anchoring.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/anchoring.png" alt="Anchoring" /></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/anchoring-abline-b.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/kickstarter/anchoring-abline-b.png" alt="Anchoring with Regression Lines" /></a></p>

  <p>So this perhaps suggests that if you&#8217;re going to price your lowest reward at 1 dollar, your next reward should cost roughly 20 dollars (or slightly more, to maximize your total revenue). Pricing above 20 dollars is a little too expensive for the folks who want to support you, but aren&#8217;t rich enough to throw gads of money; maybe rewards below 20 dollars aren&#8217;t good enough to merit the higher donation.</p>

  <p>Next, I&#8217;m planning on digging a little deeper into pricing effects and what makes a project successful, so I&#8217;ll hopefully have some more Kickstarter analysis in a future post. In the meantime, in case anyone else wants to take a look, I put the data onto <a href="https://github.com/echen/kickstarter-data-analysis">my Github account</a>.</p>
