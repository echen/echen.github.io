  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Suppose you see two drunks (i.e., two random walks) wandering around. The drunks don&#8217;t know each other (they&#8217;re independent), so there&#8217;s no meaningful relationship between their paths.</p>

  <p>But suppose instead you have a drunk walking with her dog. This time there <em>is</em> a connection. What&#8217;s the nature of this connection? Notice that although each path individually is still an unpredictable random walk, given the location of one of the drunk or dog, we have a pretty good idea of where the other is; that is, the distance between the two is fairly predictable. (For example, if the dog wanders too far away from his owner, she&#8217;ll tend to move in his direction to avoid losing him, so the two stay close together despite a tendency to wander around on their own.) We describe this relationship by saying that the drunk and her dog form a cointegrating pair.</p>

  <p>In more technical terms, if we have two non-stationary time series X and Y that become stationary when differenced (these are called integrated of order one series, or I(1) series; random walks are one example) such that some linear combination of X and Y is stationary (aka, I(0)), then we say that X and Y are cointegrated. In other words, while neither X nor Y alone hovers around a constant value, some combination of them does, so we can think of cointegration as describing a particular kind of long-run equilibrium relationship. (The definition of cointegration can be extended to multiple time series, with higher orders of integration.)</p>

  <p>Other examples of cointegrated pairs:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Income and consumption: as income increases/decreases, so too does consumption.</li>
  <li>Size of police force and amount of criminal activity</li>
  <li>A book and its movie adaptation: while the book and the movie may differ in small details, the overall plot will remain the same.</li>
  <li>Number of patients entering or leaving a hospital</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>An application</h1>

  <p>So why do we care about cointegration? In quantitative finance, cointegration forms the basis of the pairs trading strategy: suppose we have two cointegrated stocks X and Y, with the particular (for concreteness) cointegrating relationship X - 2Y = Z, where Z is a stationary series of zero mean. For example, X could be McDonald&#8217;s, Y could be Burger King, and the cointegration relationship would mean that X tends to be priced twice as high as Y, so that when X is more than twice the price of Y, we expect X to move down or Y to move up in the near future (and analogously, if X is less than twice the price of Y, we expect X to move up or Y to move down). This suggests the following trading strategy: if X - 2Y > d, for some positive threshold d, then we should sell X and buy Y (since we expect X to decrease in price and Y to increase), and similarly, if X - 2Y &lt; -d, then we should buy X and sell Y.</p>

  <h1>Spurious regression</h1>

  <p>But why do we need the notion of cointegration at all? Why can&#8217;t we simply use, say, the R-squared between X or Y to see if X and Y have some kind of relationship? The reason is that standard regression analysis fails when dealing with non-stationary variables, leading to spurious regressions that suggest relationships even when there are none.</p>

  <p>For example, suppose we regress two independent random walks against each other, and test for a linear relationship. A large percentage of the time, we&#8217;ll find high R-squared values and low p-values when using standard OLS statistics, even though there&#8217;s absolutely no relationship between the two random walks. As an illustration, here I simulated 1000 pairs of random walks of length 100, and found p-values less than 0.05 in 77% of the cases:</p>

  <h1>A Cointegration Test</h1>

  <p>So how do you detect cointegration? There are several different methods, but the simplest is the Engle-Granger test, which works roughly as follows:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Check that $ X_t $ and $ Y_t $ are both I(1).</li>
  <li>Estimate the cointegrating relationship $ Y_t = aX_t + e_t $ by ordinary least squares.</li>
  <li>Check that the cointegrating residuals $ e_t $ are stationary (say, by using a so-called unit root test, e.g., the Dickey-Fuller test).</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>Error-correction and Granger representation</h1>

  <p>Something else that should perhaps be mentioned is the relationship between cointegration and error-correction mechanisms: suppose we have two cointegrated series $ X_t, Y_t $, with autoregressive representations</p>

  <p>$ X_t = a X_{t-1} + b Y_{t-1} + u_t $
  $ Y_t = c X_{t-1} + d Y_{t-1} + v_t $</p>

  <p>By the Granger representation theorem (which is actually a bit more general than this), we then have</p>

  <p>$ \Delta X_t = \alpha_1 (Y_{t-1} - \beta X_{t-1}) + u_t $
  $ \Delta Y_t = \alpha_2 (Y_{t-1} - \beta X_{t-1}) + v_t $</p>

  <p>where $ Y_{t-1} - \beta X_{t-1} \sim I(0) $ is the cointegrating relationship. Regarding $ Y_{t-1} - \beta X_{t-1} $ as the extent of disequilibrium from the long-run relationship, and the $ \alpha_i $ as the speed (and direction) at which the time series correct themselves from this disequilibrium, we can see that this formalizes the way cointegrated variables adjust to match their long-run equilbrium.</p>

  <h1>Summary</h1>

  <p>So, just to summarize a bit, cointegration is an equilibrium relationship between time series that individually aren&#8217;t in equilbrium (you can kind of contrast this with (Pearson) correlation, which describes a linear relationship), and it&#8217;s useful because it allows us to incorporate both short-term dynamics (deviations from equilibrium) and long-run expectations (corrections to equilibrium).</p>
