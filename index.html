<p>The first time I learned about LSTMs, my eyes glazed over.</p>
<p>Not in a good, jelly donut kind of way.</p>
<p>It turns out LSTMs are a fairly simple extension to neural networks, and they're behind a lot of the amazing achievements deep learning has made in the past few years. So I'll try to present them as intuitively as possible – in such a way that you could have discovered them yourself.</p>
<p>But first, a picture:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/lnBi8OZ.png"><img alt="LSTM" src="http://i.imgur.com/lnBi8OZ.png" /></a></p>
<p>Aren't LSTMs beautiful? Let's go.</p>
<p>(Note: if you're already familiar with neural networks and LSTMs, skip to the middle – the first half of this post is a tutorial.)</p>
<h1>Neural Networks</h1>
<p>Imagine we have a sequence of images from a movie, and we want to label each image with an activity (is this a fight?, are the characters talking?, are the characters eating?).</p>
<p>How do we do this?</p>
<p>One way is to ignore the sequential nature of the images, and build a <em>per-image</em> classifier that considers each image in isolation. For example, given enough images and labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our algorithm might first learn to detect low-level patterns like shapes and edges. </li>
<li>With more data, it might learn to combine these patterns into more complex ones, like faces (two circular things atop a triangular thing atop an oval thing) or cats.</li>
<li>And with even more data, it might learn to map these higher-level patterns into activities themselves (scenes with mouths, steaks, and forks are probably about eating).</li>
</ul>
<p>This, then, is a <strong>deep neural network</strong>: it takes an image input, returns an activity output, and – just as we might learn to detect patterns in puppy behavior without knowing anything about dogs (after seeing enough corgis, we discover common characteristics like fluffy butts and drumstick legs; next, we learn advanced features like splooting) – in between it learns to represent images through hidden layers of representations.</p>
<h2>Mathematically</h2>
<p>I assume people are familiar with basic neural networks already, but let's quickly review them.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>neural network</strong> with a single hidden layer takes as input a vector x, which we can think of as a set of neurons. </li>
<li>Each input neuron is connected to a hidden layer of neurons via a set of learned weights. </li>
<li>The jth hidden neuron outputs <span class="math">\(h_j = \phi(\sum_i w_{ij} x_i)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is an activation function. </li>
<li>The hidden layer is fully connected to an output layer, and the jth output neuron outputs <span class="math">\(y_j = \sum_i u_{ij} h_i\)</span>. If we need probabilities, we can transform the output layer via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function">softmax</a> function.</li>
</ul>
<p>In matrix notation:</p>
<div class="math">$$h = \phi(Wx)$$</div>
<div class="math">$$y = Vh$$</div>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>x is our input vector</li>
<li>W is a weight matrix connecting the input and hidden layers</li>
<li>V is a weight matrix connecting the hidden and output layers</li>
<li>Common activation functions for <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">sigmoid function</a>, <span class="math">\(\sigma(x)\)</span>, which squashes numbers into the range (0, 1); the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_function#Standard_analytic_expressions">hyperbolic tangent</a>, <span class="math">\(tanh(x)\)</span>, which squashes numbers into the range (-1, 1), and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)">rectified linear unit</a>, <span class="math">\(ReLU(x) = max(0, x)\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a pictorial view:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tFMQMOn.png"><img alt="Neural Network" src="http://i.imgur.com/tFMQMOn.png" /></a></p>
<p>(Note: to make the notation a little cleaner, I assume x and h each contain an extra bias neuron fixed at 1 for learning bias weights.)</p>
<h1>Remembering Information with RNNs</h1>
<p>Ignoring the sequential aspect of the movie images is pretty ML 101, though. If we see a scene of a beach, we should boost beach activities in future frames: an image of someone in the water should probably be labeled <em>swimming</em>, not <em>bathing</em>, and an image of someone lying with their eyes closed is probably <em>suntanning</em>. If we remember that Bob just arrived at a supermarket, then even without any distinctive supermarket features, an image of Bob holding a slab of bacon should probably be categorized as <em>shopping</em> instead of <em>cooking</em>.</p>
<p>So what we'd like is to let our model track the state of the world:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>After seeing each image, the model outputs a label and also updates its knowledge of the world.</strong> For example, the model might learn to automatically discover and track information like location (are scenes currently in a house or beach?), time of day (if a scene contains an image of the moon, the model should remember that it's nighttime), and within-movie progress (is this image the first frame or the 100th?). Importantly, just as a neural network automatically discovers hidden patterns like edges, shapes, and faces without being fed them, our model should automatically discover useful information by itself.</li>
<li>When given a new image, the model should <strong>incorporate the knowledge it's gathered</strong> to do a better job.</li>
</ol>
<p>This, then, is a <strong>recurrent neural network</strong>. Instead of simply taking an image and returning an activity, an RNN also maintains internal memories about the world (weights assigned to different pieces of information) to help perform its classifications.</p>
<h2>Mathematically</h2>
<p>So let's add the notion of <strong>internal knowledge</strong> to our equations, which we can think of as memories or pieces of information that the network maintains over time. </p>
<p>But this is easy: we know that the hidden layers of neural networks already encode useful information about their inputs, so why not use these layers as memory? This gives us our RNN equations:</p>
<div class="math">$$h_t = \phi(Wx_t + Uh_{t-1})$$</div>
<div class="math">$$y_t = Vh_t$$</div>
<p>Note that the hidden state computed at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> (<span class="math">\(h_t\)</span>, our internal knowledge) is fed back at the next time step. (Also, I'll use concepts like hidden state, knowledge, memories, and beliefs to describe <span class="math">\(h_t\)</span> interchangeably.)</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ifQrKRR.png"><img alt="RNN" src="http://i.imgur.com/ifQrKRR.png" /></a></p>
<h1>Longer Memories through LSTMs</h1>
<p>Let's think about how our model updates its knowledge of the world. So far, we've placed no constraints on this update, so its knowledge can change pretty chaotically: at one frame it thinks the characters are in the US, at the next frame it sees the characters eating sushi and thinks they're in Japan, and at the next frame it sees polar bears and thinks they're on Hydra Island. Or perhaps it has a wealth of information to suggest that Alice is an investment analyst, but decides she's a professional assassin after seeing her cook.</p>
<p>This chaos means information quickly transforms and vanishes, and it's difficult for the model to keep a long-term memory. So what we'd like is for the network to <em>learn</em> how to update its beliefs (scenes without Bob shouldn't change Bob-related information, scenes with Alice should focus on gathering details about her), in a way that its knowledge of the world evolves more gently. </p>
<p>This is how we do it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Adding a forgetting mechanism.</strong> If a scene ends, for example, the model should forget the current scene location, the time of day, and reset any scene-specific information; however, if a character dies in the scene, it should continue remembering that he's no longer alive. Thus, we want the model to learn a separate <em>forgetting/remembering</em> mechanism: when new inputs come in, it needs to know which beliefs to keep or throw away.</li>
<li><strong>Adding a saving mechanism.</strong> When the model sees a new image, it needs to learn whether any information about the image is worth using and saving. Maybe your mom sent you an article about the Kardashians, but who cares?</li>
<li>So when new a input comes in, the model first forgets any long-term information it decides it no longer needs. Then it learns which parts of the new input are worth using, and saves them into its long-term memory.</li>
<li><strong>Focusing long-term memory into working memory.</strong> Finally, the model needs to learn which parts of its long-term memory are immediately useful. For example, Bob's age may be a useful piece of information to keep in the long term (children are more likely to be crawling, adults are more likely to be working), but is probably irrelevant if he's not in the current scene. So instead of using the full long-term memory all the time, it learns which parts to focus on instead.</li>
</ol>
<p>This, then, is an <strong>long short-term memory network</strong>. Whereas an RNN can overwrite its memory at each time step in a fairly uncontrolled fashion, an LSTM transforms its memory in a very precise way: by using <em>specific learning mechanisms</em> for which pieces of information to remember, which to update, and which to pay attention to. This helps it keep track of information over longer periods of time.</p>
<h2>Mathematically</h2>
<p>Let's describe the LSTM additions mathematically.</p>
<p>At time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, we receive a new input <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span>. We also have our long-term and working memories passed on from the previous time step, <span class="math">\(ltm_{t-1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(wm_{t-1}\)</span> (both n-length vectors), which we want to update.</p>
<p><strong>We'll start with our long-term memory.</strong> First, we need to know which pieces of long-term memory to continue remembering and which to discard, so we want to use the new input and our working memory to learn a <strong>remember gate</strong> of n numbers between 0 and 1, each of which determines how much of a long-term memory element to keep. (A 1 means to keep it, a 0 means to forget it entirely.)</p>
<p>Naturally, we can use a small neural network to learn this remember gate:</p>
<div class="math">$$remember_t = \sigma(W_r x_t + U_r wm_{t-1}) $$</div>
<p>(Notice the similarity to our previous network equations; this is just a shallow neural network. Also, we use a sigmoid activation because we need numbers between 0 and 1.)</p>
<p>Next, we need to compute the information we can learn from <span class="math">\(x_t\)</span>, i.e., a <strong>candidate addition to our long-term memory</strong>:</p>
<div class="math">$$ ltm'_t = \phi(W_l x_t + U_l wm_{t-1}) $$</div>
<p><span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is an activation function, commonly chosen to be <span class="math">\(tanh\)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we add the candidate into our memory, though, we want to learn <strong>which parts of it are actually worth using and saving</strong>:</p>
<div class="math">$$save_t = \sigma(W_s x_t + U_s wm_{t-1})$$</div>
<p>(Think of what happens when you read something on the web. While a news article might contain information about Hillary, you should ignore it if the source is Breitbart.)</p>
<p>Let's now combine all these steps. After forgetting memories we don't think we'll ever need again and saving useful pieces of incoming information, we have our <strong>updated long-term memory</strong>:</p>
<div class="math">$$ltm_t = remember_t \circ ltm_{t-1} + save_t \circ ltm'_t$$</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\circ\)</span> denotes element-wise multiplication.</p>
<p><strong>Next, let's update our working memory.</strong> We want to learn how to focus our long-term memory into information that will be <em>immediately</em> useful. (Put differently, we want to learn what to move from an <em>external hard drive</em> onto our <em>working laptop</em>.) So we learn a <strong>focus/attention vector</strong>:</p>
<div class="math">$$focus_t = \sigma(W_f x_t + U_f wm_{t-1})$$</div>
<p>Our <strong>working memory</strong> is then</p>
<div class="math">$$wm_t = focus_t \circ \phi(ltm_t)$$</div>
<p>In other words, we pay full attention to elements where the focus is 1, and ignore elements where the focus is 0.</p>
<p>And we're done! Hopefully this made it into your long-term memory as well.</p>
<hr />
<p>To summarize, whereas a vanilla RNN uses one equation to update its hidden state/memory:</p>
<div class="math">$$h_t = \phi(Wx_t + Uh_{t-1})$$</div>
<p>An LSTM uses several:</p>
<div class="math">$$ltm_t = remember_t \circ ltm_{t-1} + save_t \circ ltm'_t$$</div>
<div class="math">$$wm_t = focus_t \circ tanh(ltm_t)$$</div>
<p>where each memory/attention sub-mechanism is just a mini brain of its own:</p>
<div class="math">$$remember_t = \sigma(W_r x_t+  U_r wm_{t-1}) $$</div>
<div class="math">$$save_t = \sigma(W_s x_t + U_s wm_{t-1})$$</div>
<div class="math">$$focus_t = \sigma(W_f x_t + U_f wm_{t-1})$$</div>
<div class="math">$$ ltm'_t = tanh(W_l x_t + U_l wm_{t-1}) $$</div>
<p>(Note: the terminology and variable names I've been using are different from the usual literature. Here are the standard names, which I'll use interchangeably from now on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The long-term memory, <span class="math">\(ltm_t\)</span>, is usually called the <strong>cell state</strong>, denoted <span class="math">\(c_t\)</span>.</li>
<li>The working memory, <span class="math">\(wm_t\)</span>, is usually called the <strong>hidden state</strong>, denoted <span class="math">\(h_t\)</span>. This is analogous to the hidden state in vanilla RNNs.</li>
<li>The remember vector, <span class="math">\(remember_t\)</span>, is usually called the <strong>forget gate</strong> (despite the fact that a 1 in the forget gate still means to keep the memory and a 0 still means to forget it), denoted <span class="math">\(f_t\)</span>.</li>
<li>The save vector, <span class="math">\(save_t\)</span>, is usually called the <strong>input gate</strong> (as it determines how much of the input to let into the cell state), denoted <span class="math">\(i_t\)</span>.</li>
<li>The focus vector, <span class="math">\(focus_t\)</span>, is usually called the <strong>output gate</strong>, denoted <span class="math">\(o_t\)</span>.

<h2>Recurrent Neural Networks</h2>

<h2>LSTMs</h2>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/EGZIUuc.png"><img alt="LSTM" src="http://i.imgur.com/EGZIUuc.pngg" /></a></p>
<h2>Learning to Code</h2>
<p>Let's look at a few examples of what an LSTM can do. Following Andrej Karpathy's <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">terrific post</a>, I'll use character-level LSTM models that are fed sequences of characters and trained to predict the next character in the sequence. </p>
<p>While this may seem a bit toyish, character-level models can actually be very useful, even on top of word models. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Imagine a code autocompleter smart enough to allow you to program on your phone.</strong> An LSTM could (in theory) track the return type of the method you're currently in, and better suggest which variable to return; it could also know without compiling whether you've made a bug by returning the wrong type.</li>
<li><strong>NLP applications like machine translation often have trouble dealing with rare terms.</strong> How do you translate a word you've never seen before, or convert adjectives to adverbs? Even if you know what a tweet means, how do you generate a new hashtag to capture it? Character models can daydream new terms, so this is another area with <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07909.pdf">interesting applications</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So to start, I spun up an EC2 p2.xlarge spot instance, and trained a 3-layer LSTM on the <a href="https://github.com/apache/commons-lang">Apache Commons Lang codebase</a>. Here's a program it generates after a few hours.</p>
<p><code data-gist-id="de1d2d1bd34a94fba100b57b3a9e49ab" data-gist-hide-footer="true"></code></p>
<p>While the code certainly isn't perfect, it's better than a lot of data scientists I know. And we can see that the LSTM has learned a lot of interesting (and correct!) coding behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It knows how to structure classes:</strong> a license up top, followed by packages and imports, followed by comments and a class definition, followed by variables and methods. Similarly, it knows how to create methods: comments follow the correct orders (description, then @param, then @return, etc.), decorators are properly placed, and non-void methods end with appropriate return statements. Crucially, this behavior spans long ranges of code – see how giant the blocks are!</li>
<li><strong>It can also track subroutines and nesting levels:</strong> indentation is always correct, and if statements and for loops are always closed out.</li>
<li><strong>It even knows how to create tests.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How does the model do this? Let's look at a few of the hidden states.</p>
<p>Here's a neuron that seems to track the code's <em>outer</em> level of indentation (each character is colored by the neuron's state when reading the character as input, i.e., when trying to generate the next character; red cells are negative, and blue cells are positive):</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/szJnfAY.png"><img alt="http://i.imgur.com/szJnfAY.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/szJnfAY.png" /></a></p>
<p>And here's a neuron that counts down the spaces between tabs:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/EBbM9Kx.png"><img alt="http://i.imgur.com/EBbM9Kx.png" src="http://i.imgur.com/EBbM9Kx.png" /></a></p>
<p>For kicks, here's the output of a different 3-layer LSTM trained on TensorFlow's codebase:</p>
<p><code data-gist-id="926b34e5bec6cd2b304cdecabda255b1" data-gist-hide-footer="true"></code></p>
<p>There are <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">plenty of other fun examples</a> floating around the web, so check them out if you want to see more.</p>
<h1>Investigating LSTM Internals</h1>
<p>Let's dig a little deeper. We looked in the last section at examples of hidden states, but I wanted to play with LSTM cell states and their other memory mechanisms too. Do they fire when we expect, or are there surprising patterns?</p>
<h2>Counting</h2>
<p>To investigate, let's start by teaching an LSTM to count. (Remember how the Java and Python LSTMs were able to generate proper indentation!) So I generated sequences of the form</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">aaaaaXbbbbb</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(N "a" characters, followed by a delimiter X, followed by N "b" characters, where 1 &lt;= N &lt;= 10), and trained a single-layer LSTM with 10 hidden neurons.</p>
<p>As expected, the LSTM learns perfectly within its training range – and can even generalize a few steps beyond it. (Although it starts to fail once we try to get it to count to 19.)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaXbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</span>
<span class="n">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaXbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</span>
<span class="n">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaXbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</span>
<span class="n">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaXbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</span>
<span class="n">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaXbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb</span> <span class="err">#</span> <span class="n">Here</span> <span class="n">it</span> <span class="n">begins</span> <span class="n">to</span> <span class="n">fail</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">the</span> <span class="n">model</span> <span class="n">is</span> <span class="n">given</span> <span class="mi">19</span> <span class="s">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="n">outputs</span> <span class="n">only</span> <span class="mi">18</span> <span class="s">&quot;b&quot;</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">.</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We expect to find a hidden state neuron that counts the number of a's if we look as its internals. And we do:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/JEIhBeh.png"><img alt="Neuron #2 Hidden State" src="http://i.imgur.com/JEIhBeh.png" /></a></p>
<p>I built a <a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer">small web app</a> to play around with LSTMs, and <a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/neuron?file=counter&amp;layer=1&amp;n=2">Neuron #2</a> seems to be counting both the number of a's it's seen, as well as the number of b's. (Remember that cells are shaded according to the neuron's activation, from dark red [-1] to dark blue [+1].)</p>
<p>What about the cell state? It behaves similarly:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/5DB3wnJ.png"><img alt="Neuron #2 Cell State" src="http://i.imgur.com/5DB3wnJ.png" /></a></p>
<p>One interesting thing is that the working memory looks like a "sharpened" version of the long-term memory. Does this hold true in general? </p>
<p>It does. (This is exactly as we would expect, since the long-term memory gets squashed by the tanh activation function and the output gate limits what gets passed on.) For example, here is an overview of all 10 cell state nodes at once. We see plenty of light-colored cells, representing values close to 0.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/yGfaCh3.png"><img alt="Counting LSTM Cell States" src="http://i.imgur.com/yGfaCh3.png" /></a></p>
<p>In contrast, <strong>the 10 working memory neurons look much more focused</strong>. Neurons 1, 3, 5, and 7 are even zeroed out entirely over the first half of the sequence.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/scQXaPL.png"><img alt="Counting LSTM Hidden States" src="http://i.imgur.com/scQXaPL.png" /></a></p>
<p>Let's go back to Neuron #2. Here are the candidate memory and input gate. They're relatively constant over each half of the sequence – as if the neuron is calculating <code>a += 1</code> or <code>b += 1</code> at each step.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/Nu504g0.png"><img alt="Counting LSTM Candidate Memory" src="http://i.imgur.com/Nu504g0.png" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/iBkuAiV.png"><img alt="Input Gate" src="http://i.imgur.com/iBkuAiV.png" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, here's an overview of all of Neuron 2's internals:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/VUwMnHJ.png"><img alt="Neuron 2 Overview" src="http://i.imgur.com/VUwMnHJ.png" /></a></p>
<p>If you want to investigate the different counting neurons yourself, you can play around with the visualizer <a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/network?file=counter">here</a>.</p>
<iframe src="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/network?file=counter" style="width: 100%; height: 500px"></iframe>

<p>(Note: this is far from the only way an LSTM can learn to count, and I'm anthropomorphizing quite a bit here. But I think viewing the network's behavior is interesting and can help build better models – after all, many of the ideas in neural networks come from analogies to the human brain, and if we see unexpected behavior, we may be able to design more efficient learning mechanisms.)</p>
<h2>Count von Count</h2>
<p>Let's look at a slightly more complicated counter. This time, I generated sequences of the form</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">aaXaXaaYbbbbb</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(N a's with X's randomly sprinkled in, followed by a delimiter Y, followed by N b's). The LSTM still has to count the number of a's, but this time needs to ignore the X's as well. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/network?file=selective_counter">Here's the full LSTM.</a> We expect to see <strong>a counting neuron, but one where the input gate is zero whenever it sees an X.</strong> And we do!</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/fFs0MNm.png"><img alt="Counter 2 - Cell State" src="http://i.imgur.com/fFs0MNm.png" /></a></p>

It increases until it hits the delimiter Y, and then decreases to the end of the sequence – just like it's calculating a <code>num_bs_left_to_print</code> variable that increments on a's and decrements on b's.</p>
<p>If we look at its input gate, it is indeed ignoring the X's:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ccqdcn8.png"><img alt="Counter 2 - Input Gate" src="http://i.imgur.com/ccqdcn8.png" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, though, the candidate memory fully activates on the irrelevant X's – which shows why the input gate is needed. (Although, if the input gate weren't part of the architecture, presumably the network would have presumably learned to ignore the X's some other way, at least for this simple example.)</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wmjemE1.png"><img alt="Counter 2 - Candidate Memory" src="http://i.imgur.com/wmjemE1.png" /></a></p>
<p>Let's also look at <a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/neuron?file=selective_counter&amp;layer=1&amp;n=10">Neuron 10</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/02ySRxl.png"><img alt="Counter 2 - Neuron 10" src="http://i.imgur.com/02ySRxl.png" /></a></p>
<p>This neuron is interesting as it only activates when reading the delimiter "Y" – and yet it still manages to encode the number of a's seen so far in the sequence. (It may be hard to tell from the picture, but when reading Y's belonging to sequences with the same number of a's, all the cell states have values either identical or within 0.1% of each other. You can see that Y's with fewer a's are lighter than those with more.) Perhaps some other neuron sees Neuron 10 slacking and helps a buddy out.</p>

<h2>Remembering State</h2>
<p>Next, I wanted to look at how LSTMs remember state. I generated sequences of the form</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">AxxxxxxYa</span>
<span class="n">BxxxxxxYb</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(i.e., an "A" or B", followed by 1-10 x's, then a delimiter "Y", ending with a lowercase version of the initial character). This way <a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/network?file=state_memorizer">the network</a> needs to remember whether it's in an "A" or "B" state.</p>
<p>We expect to find a neuron that fires when remembering that the sequence started with an "A", and another neuron that fires when remembering that it started with a "B". We do.</p>
<p>For example, here is an "A" neuron that activates when it reads an "A", and remembers until it needs to generate the final character. Notice that the input gate ignores all the "x" characters in between.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/UfGWJ9w.png"><img alt="A Neuron - #8" src="http://i.imgur.com/UfGWJ9w.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here is its "B" counterpart:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/pAKw9Y2.png"><img alt="B Neuron - #17" src="http://i.imgur.com/pAKw9Y2.png" /></a></p>
<p>One interesting point is that even though knowledge of the A vs. B state isn't needed until the network reads the "Y" delimiter, the hidden state fires throughout all the intermediate inputs anyways. This seems a bit "inefficient", but perhaps it's because the neurons are doing a bit of double-duty in counting the number of x's as well.</p>
<iframe src="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/neuron?file=state_memorizer&layer=1&n=8" style="width: 100%; height: 500px"></iframe>

<h2>Copy Task</h2>
<p>Finally, let's look at how an LSTM learns to copy information. (Recall that our Java LSTM was able to memorize and copy an Apache license.)</p>
<p>(Note: if you think about how LSTMs work, remembering lots of individual, detailed pieces of information isn't something they're very good at. For example, you may have noticed that one major flaw of the LSTM-generated code was that it often made use of undefined variables – the LSTMs couldn't remember which variables were in scope. This isn't surprising, since it's hard to use single cells to efficiently encode multi-valued information like characters, and LSTMs don't have a natural mechanism to chain adjacent memories to form words. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895">Memory networks</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5401">neural Turing machines</a> are two extensions to neural networks that help fix this, by augmenting with external memory components. So while copying isn't something LSTMs do very efficiently, it's fun to see how they try anyways.)</p>
<p>For this copy task, I trained a tiny 2-layer LSTM on sequences of the form</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">baaXbaa</span>
<span class="n">abcXabc</span>
</pre></div>


<p>(i.e., a 3-character subsequence composed of a's, b's, and c's, followed by a delimiter "X", followed by the same subsequence).</p>
<p>I wasn't sure what "copy neurons" would look like, so in order to find neurons that were memorizing parts of the initial subsequence, I looked at their hidden states when reading the delimiter X. Since the network needs to encode the initial subsequence, its states should exhibit different patterns depending on what they're learning.</p>
<p>The graph below, for example, plots Neuron 5's hidden state when reading the "X" delimiter. The neuron is clearly able to distinguish sequences beginning with a "c" from those that don't.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/QdQXIVu.png"><img alt="Neuron 5" src="http://i.imgur.com/QdQXIVu.png" /></a></p>
<p>For another example, here is Neuron 20's hidden state when reading the "X". It looks like it picks out sequences beginning with a "b".</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ud8NjEA.png"><img alt="Neuron 20 Hidden State" src="http://i.imgur.com/ud8NjEA.png" /></a></p>
<p>Interestingly, if we look at Neuron 20's <em>cell</em> state, it almost seems to capture the entire 3-character subsequence by itself (no small feat given its one-dimensionality!):</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/PLpSocg.png"><img alt="Neuron 20 Cell State" src="http://i.imgur.com/PLpSocg.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here are <a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/neuron?file=copy_machine&amp;layer=1&amp;n=20">Neuron 20's cell and hidden states</a>, across the entire sequence. Notice that <strong>its hidden state is turned off over the entire initial subsequence</strong> (perhaps expected, since its memory only needs to be passively kept at that point).</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/dO0Ai6H.png"><img alt="Copy LSTM - Neuron 20 Hidden and Cell" src="http://i.imgur.com/dO0Ai6H.png" /></a></p>
<p>However, if we look more closely, the neuron actually seems to be firing whenever the <em>next</em> character is a "b". So rather than being a "the sequence started with a b" neuron, it appears to be a "the next character is a b" neuron.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this pattern holds across the network – all the neurons seem to be predicting the next character, rather than memorizing characters at specific positions. For example, <a href="http://blog.echen.me/lstm-explorer/#/neuron?file=copy_machine&amp;layer=1&amp;n=5">Neuron 5</a> seems to be a "next character is a c" predictor.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/30LKz6j.png"><img alt="Copy LSTM - Neuron 5" src="http://i.imgur.com/30LKz6j.png" /></a></p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is the default kind of behavior LSTMs learn when copying information, or what other copying mechanisms are available as well.</p>

<h1>Extensions</h1>
<p>Let's recap a bit how you could have discovered LSTMs by yourself.</p>
<p>First, many of the problems we'd like to solve are sequential or temporal of some sort, so we should incorporate past learnings into our models. But we already know that the hidden layers of neural networks encode useful information, so why not use these hidden layers as the memories we pass from one time step to the next? <strong>And so we get RNNs.</strong></p>
<p>But we know from our own behavior that we don't keep track of knowledge willy-nilly; when we read a new article about politics, we don't immediately believe whatever it tells us and incorporate it into our beliefs of the world. We selectively decide what information to save, what information to discard, and what pieces of information to use to make decisions the next time we read the news. Thus, we want to <em>learn</em> how to gather, update, and apply information – and why not learn these things through their own mini neural networks? <strong>And so we get LSTMs.</strong></p>
<p>And now that we've gone through this process, we can come up with our own modifications.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, maybe you think it's silly for LSTMs to distinguish between long-term and working memories – why not have one? Or maybe you find separate remember gates and save gates kind of redundant – anything we forget should be replaced by new information, and vice-versa. <strong>And so now you've come up with one popular LSTM variant, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555">GRU</a></strong>.</li>
<li>Or maybe you think that when deciding what information to remember, save, and focus on, we shouldn't rely on our working memory alone – why not use our long-term memory as well? <strong>And so now you've discovered <a href="http://machinelearning.wustl.edu/mlpapers/paper_files/GersSS02.pdf">Peephole LSTMs</a></strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Making Neural Nets Great Again</h1>
<p>Let's look at one final example, using a 2-layer LSTM trained on Trump's tweets. Despite the <del>tiny</del> <em>big</em> dataset, it's enough to learn a lot of patterns.</p>
<p>For example, here's a neuron that tracks its position within hashtags, URLs, and @mentions:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eBJQLOf.png"><img alt="Hashtags, URLs, @mentions" src="http://i.imgur.com/eBJQLOf.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here's a proper noun detector (note that it's not simply firing at capitalized words):</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/SC4XMHr.png"><img alt="Proper Nouns" src="http://i.imgur.com/SC4XMHr.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here's an auxiliary verb + "to be" detector ("will be", "I've always been", "has never been"):</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/fRdatTW.png"><img alt="Modal Verbs" src="http://i.imgur.com/fRdatTW.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here's a quote attributor:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wQA8H0Q.png"><img alt="Quotes" src="http://i.imgur.com/wQA8H0Q.png" /></a></p>
<p>There's even a MAGA and capitalization neuron:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/1QdT0MS.png"><img alt="MAGA" src="http://i.imgur.com/1QdT0MS.png" /></a></p>
<p>And here are some of the proclamations the LSTM generates (one of these is actually a real tweet; I'll let you guess which):</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YSVVWGp.png"><img alt="Tweets" src="http://i.imgur.com/YSVVWGp.png" /></a>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/A6RbIyF.png"><img alt="Tweet" src="http://i.imgur.com/A6RbIyF.png" /></a></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the LSTM merely learned to ramble like a madman.</p>
<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>That's it. To summarize, here's what you've learned:</p>

<div class="post-info">

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Imagine you're building a recommendation algorithm for your new online site. How do you measure its quality, to make sure that it's sending users relevant and personalized content? Click-through rate may be your initial hope…but after a bit of thought, it's not clear that it's the best metric after all.</p>
<p><strong>Take Google's search engine.</strong> In many cases, improving the quality of search results will <em>decrease</em> CTR! For example, the ideal scenario for queries like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when%20was%20barack%20obama%20born">When was Barack Obama born?</a> is that users never have to click, since the question should be answered on the page itself.</p>
<p><strong>Or take Twitter, who one day might want to recommend you interesting tweets.</strong> Metrics like CTR, or even number of favorites and retweets, will probably optimize for showing quick one-liners and pictures of funny cats. But is a Reddit-like site what Twitter really wants to be? Twitter, for many people, started out as a news site, so users may prefer seeing links to deeper and more interesting content, even if they're less likely to click on each individual suggestion overall.</p>
<p><strong>Or take eBay, who wants to help you find the products you want to buy.</strong> Is CTR a good measure? Perhaps not: more clicks may  be an indication that you're having trouble finding what you're looking for. What about revenue? That might not be ideal either: from the user perspective, you want to make your purchases at the lowest possible price, and by optimizing for revenue, eBay may be turning you towards more expensive products that make you a less frequent customer in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>And so on.</strong></p>
<p>So on many online sites, it's unclear how to measure the quality of personalization and recommendations using metrics like CTR, or revenue, or dwell time, or whatever. What's an engineer to do?</p>
<p>Well, consider the fact that many of these are <em>relevance</em> algorithms. Google wants to show you relevant search results. Twitter wants to show you relevant tweets and ads. Netflix wants to recommend you relevant movies. LinkedIn wants to find you relevant people to follow. <strong>So why, so often, do we never try to measure the relevance of our models?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2013/01/08/improving-twitter-search-with-real-time-human-computation/"><em>man-in-the-machine</em> techniques</a>, so to get around this problem, I'm going to talk about a <strong>human evaluation</strong> approach to measuring the performance of personalization and discovery products. In particular, I'll use the example of related book suggestions on Amazon as I walk through the rest of this post.</p>
<h1>Amazon, and Moving Beyond Log-Based Metrics</h1>
<p>(Let's continue motivating a bit why log-based metrics are often imperfect measures of relevance and quality, as this is an important but difficult-to-understand point.)</p>
<p>So take Amazon's <em>Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought</em> feature, which tries to show you related books.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NoTD5Vk.png"><img alt="Amazon Related Books" src="http://i.imgur.com/NoTD5Vk.png" /></a></p>
<p>To measure its effectiveness, the standard approach is to run a live experiment and measure the change in metrics like revenue or CTR.</p>
<p>But imagine we suddenly replace all of Amazon's book suggestions with pornography. What's going to happen? <a href="http://www.lazygamer.net/general-news/a-history-of-evony-ads-the-insanity-continues/"><em>CTR's likely to shoot through the roof!</em></a></p>
<p>Or suppose that we replace all of Amazon's related books with shinier, more expensive items. Again, CTR and revenue are likely to increase, as the flashier content draws eyeballs. But is this anything but a short-term boost? Perhaps the change decreases total sales in the long run, as customers start to find Amazon too expensive for their tastes and move to other marketplaces.</p>
<p>Scenarios like these are the machine learning analogue of turning ads into blinking marquees. While they might increase clicks and views initially, they're probably not optimizing user happiness or site quality for the future. So how can we avoid them, and ensure that the quality of our suggestions remains consistently high? <strong>This is a <em>related</em> books algorithm, after all – so why, by sticking to a live experiment and metrics like CTR, are we nowhere inspecting the relatedness of our recommendations?</strong></p>
<h1>Human Evaluation</h1>
<p>Solution: let's inject humans into the process. Computers can't measure relatedness (if they could, we'd be done), but people of course can.</p>
<p>For example, in the screenshot below, I asked a worker (on a crowdsourcing platform I've built on my own) to rate the first three <em>Customers Who Bought This Also Bought</em> suggestions for a book on <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/">barnesandnoble.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XBE6tvc.png"><img alt="Fool's Assassin" src="http://i.imgur.com/XBE6tvc.png" /></a></p>
<p>(Copying the text from the screenshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Fool's Assassin</em>, by Robin Hobb.</strong> (original book) "I only just read this recently, but it's one of my favorites of this year's releases. This book was so beautifully written. I've always been a fan of the Fantasy genre, but often times it's all stylistically similar. Hobb has a wonderful way with characters and narration. The story was absolutely heartbreaking and lead me wanting another book."</li>
<li><strong><em>The Broken Eye (Lightbringer Series #3)</em>, by Brent Weeks.</strong> (first related book) "It's a good, but not great, recommendation. This book sounds interesting enough. It's third in a series though, so I'd have to see how I like the first couple of books first."</li>
<li><strong><em>Dust and Light: A Sanctuary Novel</em>, by Carol Berg.</strong> (second related book) "It's an okay recommendation. I'm not so familiar with this author, but I like some of the premise of the book. I know the saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover...' but the cover art doesn't really appeal to me and kind of turns me off of the book."</li>
<li><strong><em>Tower Lord</em>, by Anthony Ryan.</strong> (third related book) "It's a good, but not great, recommendation. Another completely unfamiliar author to me (kind of like this though, it shows me new places to look for books!) This is also a sequel, though, so I'd have to see how I liked the first book before purchasing this one.")</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendations are decent, but already we see a couple ways to improve them:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, two of the recommendations (<em>The Broken Eye</em> and <em>Tower Lord</em>) are each part of a series, but not Book #1. So one improvement would be to ensure that only series introductions get displayed unless they're followups to the main book.</li>
<li>Book covers matter! Indeed, the second suggestion looks more like a fantasy romance novel than the kind of fantasy that Robin Hobb tends to write. (So perhaps B&amp;N should invest in some deep learning...)</li>
</ul>
<p>CTR and revenue certainly wouldn't give us this level of information, and it's not clear that they could even tell us our algorithms are producing irrelevant suggestions in the first place. Nowhere does the related scroll panel make it clear that two of the books are part of a series, so the CTR on those two books would be just as high as if they were indeed the series introductions. And if revenue is low, it's not clear whether it's because the suggestions are bad or because, separately, our pricing algorithms need improvement.</p>
<p>So in general, here's one way to understand the quality of a <em>Do This Next</em> algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a bunch of items (e.g., books if we're Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble), and generate their related brethren.</li>
<li>Send these <item, related items> pairs off to a bunch of judges (say, by using a crowdsourcing platform like <a href="https://www.gethybrid.io">Hybrid</a>), and ask them to rate their relevance.</li>
<li>Analyze the data that comes back.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Algorithmic Relevance on Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Google</h1>
<p>Let's make this process concrete. Pretend I'm a newly minted VP of What Customers Also Buy at Amazon, and I want to understand the product's flaws and stars.</p>
<p>I started by asking a couple hundred of my own human workers to take a book they enjoyed in the past year, and to find it on Amazon. They'd then take the first three related book suggestions from a different author, rate them on the following scale, and explain their ratings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great suggestion.</strong> I'd definitely buy it. (Very positive)</li>
<li><strong>Decent suggestion.</strong> I might buy it. (Mildly positive)</li>
<li><strong>Not a great suggestion.</strong> I probably wouldn't buy it. (Mildly negative)</li>
<li><strong>Terrible suggestion.</strong> I definitely wouldn't buy it. (Very negative)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: I usually prefer a three-point or five-point Likert scale with a "neutral" option, but I was feeling a little wild.)</p>
<p>For example, here's how a rater reviewed the related books for Anne Rice's <em>The Wolves of Midwinter</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eh9VKhR.png"><img alt="Anne Rice" src="http://i.imgur.com/eh9VKhR.png" /></a></p>
<p>So how good are Amazon's recommendations? Quite good, in fact: 47% of raters said they'd definitely buy the first related book, another 29% said it was good enough that they might buy it, and only 24% of raters disliked the suggestion.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/MNSGpIi.png"><img alt="A1 Ratings" src="http://i.imgur.com/MNSGpIi.png" /></a></p>
<p>The second and third book suggestions, while a bit worse, seem to perform pretty well too: around 65% of raters rated them positive.</p>
<p>What can we learn from the bad ratings? I ran a follow-up task that asked workers to categorize the bad related books, and here's the breakdown.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/h4DOvju.png"><img alt="Bad Suggestions Breakdown" src="http://i.imgur.com/h4DOvju.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related but different-subtopic.</strong> These were book suggestions that were generally related to the original book, but that were in a different sub-topic that the rater wasn't interested in. For example, the first related book for Sun Tzu's <em>The Art of War</em> (a book nominally about war, but which nowadays has become more of a life hack book) was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-War-Carl-von-Clausewitz/dp/1469947021"><em>On War</em></a> (a war treatise), but the rater wasn't actually interested in the military aspects: <em>"I would not buy this book, because it only focuses on military war. I am not interested in that. I am interested in mental tactics that will help me prosper in life."</em></li>
<li><strong>Completely unrelated.</strong> These were book suggestions that were completely unrelated to the original book. For example, a Scrabble dictionary appearing on <em>The Art of War</em>'s page.</li>
<li><strong>Uninteresting.</strong> These were suggestions that were related, but whose storylines didn't appeal to the rater. <em>"The storyline doesn't seem that exciting.  I am not a dog fan and it's about a dog."</em></li>
<li><strong>Wrong audience.</strong> These were book suggestions whose target audiences were quite different from the original book's audiences. In many cases, for example, a related book suggestion would be a children's book, but the original book would be geared towards adults. <em>"This seems to be a children's book. If I had a child I would definitely buy this; alas I do not, so I have no need for it."</em></li>
<li><strong>Wrong book type.</strong> Suggestions in this category were items like textbooks or appearing alongside novels.</li>
<li><strong>Disliked author.</strong> These recommendations were by similar authors, but one that the rater disliked. <em>"I do not like Amber Portwood.  I would definitely not want to read a book by and about her."</em></li>
<li><strong>Not first in series.</strong> Some book recommendations would be for an interesting series the rater wasn't familiar with, but they wouldn't be the first book in the series.</li>
<li><strong>Bad rating.</strong> These were book suggestions that had a particularly low Amazon rating.</li>
</ul>
<p>So to improve their recommendations, Amazon could try improving its topic models, add age-based features to its books, distinguish between textbooks and novels, and invest in series detectors. (Of course, for all I know, they do all this already.)</p>
<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>We now have a general grasp of Amazon's related book suggestions and how they could be improved, and just like we could quote a metric like a CTR of 6.2% or whatnot, we can also now quote a <em>relevance score</em> of 0.62 (or whatever). So let's turn to the question of how Amazon compares to other online booksellers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Google Play.</p>
<p>I took the same task I used above, but this time asked raters to review the related suggestions on those two sites as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/kdWcSPs.png"><img alt="Amazon vs. B&amp;N vs. Google" src="http://i.imgur.com/kdWcSPs.png" /></a></p>
<p>In short,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barnes &amp; Nobles's algorithm are almost as good as Amazon's</strong>: the first three suggestions were rated positive 58% of the time, compared to 68% on Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>But Play Store recommendations are atrocious</strong> : a whopping 51% of Google's related book recommendations were marked terrible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are the Play Store's suggestions so bad? Let's look at a couple examples.</p>
<p>Here's the Play Store page for John Green's <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>, a critics-loved-it book about cancer and romance (and now also a movie).</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/oYKFLeV.png"><img alt="Fault in Our Stars" src="http://i.imgur.com/oYKFLeV.png" /></a></p>
<p>Two of the suggestions are completely random: a poorly-rated Excel manual and a poorly-reviewed textbook on sexual health. The others are completely unrelated cowboy books, by a different John Green.</p>
<p>Here's the page for <em>The Strain</em>. In this case, all the suggestions are in a different language! And there are only four of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/F1XNxPz.png"><img alt="The Strain" src="http://i.imgur.com/F1XNxPz.png" /></a></p>
<p>Once again asking raters to categorize all of the Play Store's bad recommendations...</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/1rWRQ0r.png"><img alt="Google Atrocity" src="http://i.imgur.com/1rWRQ0r.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>45% of the time, the related book suggestions were completely unrelated to the original book in question. For example: displaying a physics textbook on the page for a romance novel.</li>
<li>32% of the time, there simply wasn't a book suggestion at all. (I'm guessing the Play Bookstore's catalog is pretty limited.)</li>
<li>14% of the time, the related books were in a different language.</li>
</ul>
<p>So despite Google's state-of-the-art machine learning elsewhere, its Play Store suggestions couldn't really get much worse.</p>
<h1>Side-by-Sides</h1>
<p>Let's step back a bit. So far I've been focusing on an <em>absolute</em> judgments paradigm, in which judges rate how relevant a book is to the original on an absolute scale. This model is great for understanding the overall quality of Amazon's related book algorithm.</p>
<p>In many cases, though, we want to use human evaluation to <em>compare</em> experiments. For example, it's common at many companies to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch a "human evaluation A/B test" before a live experiment, both to avoid accidentally sending out incredibly buggy experiments to users, as well as to avoid the long wait required in live tests.</li>
<li>Use a human-generated relevance score as a supplement to live experiment metrics when making launch decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these kinds of tasks, what's preferable is often a <em>side-by-side</em> model, wherein judges are given two items and asked which one is better. After all, comparative judgments are often much easier to make than absolute ones, and we might want to detect differences at a finer level than what's available on an absolute scale.</p>
<p>The idea is that we can assign a score to each rating (negative, say, if the rater prefers the control item; positive if the rater prefers the experiment), and we aggregate these to form an overall score for the side-by-side. Then in much the same way that drops in CTR may block an experiment launch, a negative human evaluation score should also give much cause for concern.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have an easy way to generate data for a side-by-side (though I could perform a side-by-side on Amazon vs. Barnes &amp; Noble), so I'll omit an example, but the idea should be pretty clear.</p>
<h1>Personalization</h1>
<p>Here's another subtlety. In my examples above, I asked raters to pick a starting book themselves (one that they read and loved in the past year), and then rate whether they personally would want to read the related suggestions.</p>
<p>Another approach is to pick the starting books <em>for</em> the raters, and then have the rate the related suggestions more objectively, by trying to put themselves in the shoes of someone who'd be interested in the starting item.</p>
<p>Which approach is better? As you can probably guess, there's no clear answer – it depends on the task and goals at hand.</p>
<p>Pros of the first approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's much more nuanced. It can often be hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes: would someone reading Harry Potter be interested in Twilight? On the one hand, they're both fantasy books; on the other hand, Twilight seems a bit more geared towards female audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros of the second approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, objectivity is a good thing. (Should you really care if someone dislikes Twilight simply because Edward reminds her of her boyfriend?)</li>
<li>Allowing people to choose their starting items may bias certain metrics. For instance, people are much more likely to choose popular books to rate, whereas we might want to measure the quality of Amazon's suggestions across a broader, more representative slice of its catalog.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>Let's review what I've discussed so far.</p>
<ol>
<li>Online, log-based metrics like CTR and revenue aren't necessarily the best measures of a discovery algorithm's quality. Items with high CTR, for example, may simply be racy and flashy, not the most relevant.</li>
<li>So instead of relying on these proxies, let's directly measure the relevance of our recommendations by asking a pool of human raters.</li>
<li>There are a couple different approaches for sending which items to be judged. We can let the raters choose the items (an approach which is often necessary for personalized algorithms), or we can generate the items ourselves (often useful for more objective tasks like search; this also has the benefit of making it easier to derive popularity-weighted or uniformly-weighted metrics of relevance). We can also take an absolute judgment approach, or use side-by-sides.</li>
<li>By analyzing the data from our evaluations, we can make better launch decisions, discover examples where our algorithms do very well or very poorly, and find patterns for improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are some of the benefits and applications?  </p>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned, log-based metrics like CTR and revenue don't always capture the signals we want, so human-generated scores of relevance (or other dimensions) are useful complements.</li>
<li>Human evaluations can make iteration quicker and easier. A algorithm change might normally require weeks of live testing before we gather enough data to know how it affects users, but we can easily have a task judged by humans in a couple hours.</li>
<li>Imagine we're an advertising company, and we choose which ads to show based on a combination of CTR and revenue. Once we gather hundreds of thousands of relevance judgments from our evaluations, we can build a <em>relevance</em>-based machine learning model to add to the mix, thereby injecting a more direct measure of quality into the system.</li>
<li>How can we decide what improvements need to be made to our models? Evaluations give us very concrete feedback and specific examples about what's working and what's wrong.</li>
</ol>

<div class="post-info">

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Imagine you just started a job at a new company. You watched <a href="http://youtu.be/AcNK7M2eCI4?t=1m5s">World War Z</a> recently, so you're in a skeptical mood, and given that your last two startups failed from what you believe to be a lack of data, you're giving everything an extra critical eye.</p>
<p>You start by thinking about the impact of the sales team. <em>How much extra revenue are they generating for the company?</em> The sales folks you've met say that over 90% of the leads they've talked to end up buying the company's product – but, you wonder, how many of those leads would have converted anyways?</p>
<p>You take a look at the logs, and notice something interesting: last week was hack week, and half the salesforce took time off from making calls to make Marauder's Maps instead, yet the rate of converted leads remained the same...*</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of your teammates drops by your desk. He's making a batch of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/technology/personaltech/the-soylent-revolution-will-not-be-pleasurable.html">Soylent</a>, and he wants you to take a sip. It looks nasty, so you ask what the benefits are, and he responds that his friends who've been drinking it for the past few months just ran a marathon! <em>Oh, did they just start running?</em> Nope, they ran the marathon last year too!...</p>
<p>*Inspired by a true story.</p>
<h1>Causal Inference</h1>
<p>Causality is incredibly important, yet often extremely difficult to establish.</p>
<p>Do patients who self-select into taking a new drug get better <em>because</em> the drug works, or would they have gotten better anyways? Is your salesforce actually effective, or are they simply talking to the customers who already plan to convert? Is Soylent (or your company's million-dollar ad campaign) truly worth your time?</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we'd be able to run experiments – the gold standard for measuring causality – whenever we wish. In the real world, however, we can't. There are ethical qualms with giving certain patients placebos, or dangerous and untested drugs. Management may be unwilling to take a potential short-term revenue hit by assigning sales to random customers, and a team earning commission-based bonuses may rebel against the thought as well.</p>
<p>How can we understand causal lifts in the absence of an A/B test? This is where propensity modeling, or other techniques of causal inference, comes into play.</p>
<h1>Propensity Modeling</h1>
<p>So suppose we want to model the effect of drinking Soylent using a propensity model technique. To explain the idea, let's start with a thought experiment. </p>
<p>Imagine Brad Pitt has a twin brother, indistinguishable in every way: Brad 1 and Brad 2 wake up at the same time, they eat the same foods, they exercise the same amount, and so on. One day, Brad 1 happens to receive the last batch of Soylent from a marketer on the street, while Brad 2 does not, and so only Brad 1 begins to incorporate Soylent into his diet. In this scenario, any subsequent difference in behavior between the twins is precisely the drink's effect.</p>
<p>Taking this scenario into the real world, one way to estimate the Soylent's effect on health would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every Soylent drinker, find a Soylent abstainer who's as close a match as possible. For example, we might match a Soylent-drinking Jay-Z with a non-Soylent Kanye, a Soylent-drinking Natalie Portman with a non-Soylent Keira Knightley, and a Soylent-drinking JK Rowling with a non-Soylent Stephenie Meyer.</li>
<li>We measure Soylent's effect as the difference between each twin pair.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, finding closely matching twins is extremely difficult in practice. Is Jay-Z really a close match with Kanye, if Jay-Z sleeps one hour more on average? What about the Jonas Brothers and One Direction?</p>
<p><strong>Propensity modeling</strong>, then, is a simplification of this twin matching procedure. Instead of matching pairs of people based on all the variables we have, we simply match all users based on a single number, the likelihood ("propensity") that they'll start to drink Soylent.</p>
<p>In more detail, here's how to build a propensity model.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, select which variables to use as features. (e.g., what foods people eat, when they sleep, where they live, etc.)</li>
<li>Next, build a probabilistic model (say, a logistic regression) based on these variables to predict whether a user will start drinking Soylent or not. For example, our training set might consist of a set of people, some of whom ordered Soylent in the first week of March 2014, and we would train the classifier to model which users become the Soylent users.</li>
<li>The model's probabilistic estimate that a user will start drinking Soylent is called a <strong>propensity score</strong>.</li>
<li>Form some number of buckets, say 10 buckets in total (one bucket covers users with a 0.0 - 0.1 propensity to take the drink, a second bucket covers users with a 0.1 - 0.2 propensity, and so on), and place people into each one.</li>
<li>Finally, compare the drinkers and non-drinkers within each bucket (say, by measuring their subsequent physical activity, weight, or whatever measure of health) to estimate Soylent's causal effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here's a hypothetical distribution of Soylent and non-Soylent ages. We see that drinkers tend to be quite a bit older, and this confounding fact is one reason we can't simply run a correlational analysis.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vQQACqf.png"><img alt="Age Distribution" src="http://i.imgur.com/vQQACqf.png" /></a></p>
<p>After training a model to estimate Soylent propensity and group users into propensity buckets, this might be a graph of the effect that Soylent has on a person's weekly running mileage.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/GwxpWve.png"><img alt="Soylent Effect" src="http://i.imgur.com/GwxpWve.png" /></a></p>
<p>In the above (hypothetical) graph, each row represents a propensity bucket of people, and the exposure week denotes the first week of March, when the treatment group received their Soylent shipment. We see that prior to that week, both groups of people track quite well. After the treatment group (the Soylent drinkers) start their plan, however, their weekly running mileage ramps up, which forms our estimate of the drink's causal effect.</p>
<h1>Other Methods of Causal Inference</h1>
<p>Of course, there are many other methods of causal inference on observational data. I'll run through two of my favorites. (I originally wrote this post in response to a question on Quora, which is why I take my examples from there.)</p>
<h2>Regression Discontinuity</h2>
<p>Quora recently started displaying badges of status on the profiles of its <a href="http://blog.quora.com/Announcing-Top-Writers-2013">Top Writers</a>, so suppose we want to understand the effect of this feature. (Assume that it's impossible to run an A/B test now that the feature has been launched.) Specifically, does the badge itself cause users to gain more followers?</p>
<p>For simplicity, let's assume that the badge was given to all users who received at least 5000 upvotes in 2013. The idea behind a <strong>regression discontinuity design</strong> is that the difference between those users who just barely receive a Top Writer badge (i.e., receive 5000 upvotes) and those who just barely don't (i.e., receive 4999 upvotes) is more or less random chance, so we can use this threshold to estimate a causal effect.</p>
<p>For example, in the imaginary graph below, the discontinuity at 5000 upvotes suggests that a Top Writer badge leads to around 100 more followers on average.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/7Mprryq.png"><img alt="Regression Discontinuity" src="http://i.imgur.com/7Mprryq.png" /></a></p>
<h2>Natural Experiments</h2>
<p>Understanding the effect of a Top Writer badge is a fairly uninteresting question, though. (It just makes an easy example.) A deeper, more fundamental question could be to ask: what happens when a user discovers a new writer that they love? Does the writer inspire them to write some of their own content, to explore more of the same topics, and through curation lead them to engage with the site even more? How important, in other words, is the connection to a great <em>user</em> as opposed to the reading of random, great <em>posts</em>?</p>
<p>I studied an analogous question when I was at Google, so instead of making up an imaginary Quora case study, I'll describe some of that work here.</p>
<p>So let's suppose we want to understand what would happen if we were able to match users to the perfect YouTube channel. How much is the ultimate recommendation worth?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does falling in love with a new channel lead to engagement above and beyond activity on the channel itself, perhaps because users return to YouTube specifically for the new channel and stay to watch more? (a <strong>multiplicative</strong> effect) In the TV world, for example, perhaps many people stay at home on Sunday nights <em>specifically</em> to catch the latest episode of Real Housewives, and channel surf for even more entertainment once it's over.</li>
<li>Does falling in love with a new channel simply increase activity on the channel alone? (an <strong>additive</strong> effect)</li>
<li>Does a new channel replace existing engagement on YouTube? After all, maybe users only have a limited amount of time they can spend on the site. (a <strong>neutral</strong> effect)</li>
<li>Does the perfect channel actually cause users to spend less time overall on the site, since maybe they spend less time idly browsing and channel surfing once they have concrete channels they know how to turn to? (a <strong>negative</strong> effect)</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, an A/B test would be ideal, but it's impossible in this case to run: we can't force users to fall in love with a channel (we can recommend them channels, but there's no guarantee they'll actually like them), and we can't forcibly block them from certain channels either.</p>
<p>One approach is to use a <strong>natural experiment</strong> (a scenario in which the universe itself somehow generates a random-like assignment) to study this effect. Here's the idea.</p>
<p>Consider a user who uploads a new video every Wednesday. One month, he lets his subscribers know that he won’t be uploading any new videos for a few weeks, while he goes on vacation.</p>
<p>How do his subscribers respond? Do they stop watching YouTube on Wednesdays, since his channel was the sole reason for their visits? Or is their activity relatively unaffected, since they only watch his content when it appears on the front page?</p>
<p>Imagine, instead, that the channel starts uploading a new video every Friday. Do his subscribers start to visit then as well? And now that they're on YouTube, do they merely stay for the new video, or does their visit lead to a sinkhole of searches and related content too?</p>
<p>As it turns out, these scenarios do happen. For example, here's a calendar of when one popular channel uploads videos. You can see that in 2011, it tended to upload videos on Tuesdays and Fridays, but it shifted to uploads on Wednesday and Saturday at the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wCiHHAD.png"><img alt="Uploads Calendar" src="http://i.imgur.com/wCiHHAD.png" /></a></p>
<p>By using this shift as natural experiment that "quasi-randomly" removes a well-loved channel on certain days and introduces it on others, we can try to understand the effect of successfully making the perfect recommendation.</p>
<p>(This is probably a somewhat convoluted example of a natural experiment. For an example that perhaps illustrates the idea more clearly, suppose we want to understand the effect of income on mental health. We can't force some people to become poor or rich, and a correlational study is clearly flawed. <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/what-happens-when-the-poor-receive-a-stipend/">This NY Times article</a> describes a natural experiment when a group of Cherokee Indians distributed casino profits to its members, thereby "randomly" lifting some of them out of poverty.</p>
<p>Another example, assuming there's nothing special about the period in which hack week occurs, is the use of hack week as an instrument that quasi-randomly "prevents" the sales team from doing their job, as in the scenario I described above.)</p>
<h1>Discovering Drivers of Growth</h1>
<p>Let's go back to propensity modeling.</p>
<p>Imagine that we're on our company's Growth team, and we're tasked with figuring out how to turn casual users of the site into users that return every day. What do we do?</p>
<p>The propensity modeling approach might be the following. We could take a list of features (installing the mobile app, logging in, signing up for a newsletter, following certain users, etc.), and build a propensity model for each one. We could then rank each feature by its estimated causal effect on engagement, and use the ordered list of features to prioritize our next sprint. (Or we could use these numbers in order to convince the exec team that we need more resources.) This is a slightly more sophisticated version of the idea of building an engagement regression model (or a churn regression model), and examining the weights on each feature.</p>
<p>Despite writing this post, though, I admit I'm generally not a fan of propensity modeling for many applications in the tech world. (I haven't worked in the medical field, so I don't have a strong opinion on its usefulness there, though I think it's a little more necessary there.) I'll save more of my reasons for another time, but after all, causal inference is extremely difficult, and we're never going to be able to control for all the hidden influencers that can bias a treatment. Also, the mere fact that we have to choose which features to include in our model (and remember: building features is very time-consuming and difficult) means that we already have a strong prior belief on the usefulness of each feature, whereas what we'd really like to do is to discover hidden motivations of engagement that we've never thought of.</p>
<p>So what can we do instead?</p>
<p><strong>If we're trying to understand what drives people to become heavy users of the site, why don't we simply ask them?</strong></p>
<p>In more detail, let's do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we'll run a survey on a couple hundred of users.</li>
<li>In the survey, we'll ask them whether their engagement on the site has increased, decreased, or remained about the same over the past year. We'll also ask them to explain possible reasons for their change in activity, and to describe how they use the site currently. We can also ask for supplemental details, like their demographic information.</li>
<li>Finally, we can filter all responses for those users who heavily increased their engagement over the past year (or who heavily decreased it, if we're trying to understand churn), and analyse their responses for the reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here's one interesting response I got when I ran this study at YouTube.</p>
<p><em>"I have always been a big music fan, but recently I took up playing the guitar. Because of my new found passion (playing the guitar) my desire to watch concerts has increased. I started watching a whole lot of music festivals and concerts that are posted on Youtube and other music videos. I have spent a lot of time also watching guitar lessons on Youtube (from www.justinguitar.com)."</em></p>
<p>This response was representative of a general theme the survey uncovered: one big driver of engagement seemed to come from people discovering a new offline hobby, and using YouTube to increase their appreciation of it. People who wanted to start cooking at home would turn to YouTube for recipe videos, people who started playing tennis or some other sport would go to YouTube for lessons or other great shots, college students would look for channels like Khan Academy to supplement their lectures, and so on. In other words, offline activities were driving online growth, and instead of trying to figure out what kinds of <em>online</em> content people were interested in (which articles did they like on Facebook, who did they follow on Twitter, what did they read on Reddit), perhaps we should have been focusing on bringing their physical hobbies into the digital world.</p>
<p>This "offline hobby" idea certainly wouldn't have been a feature I would have thrown into any engagement model, even if only because it's a very difficult feature to create. (How do we know which videos are related to real-world behavior?) But now that we suspect it's a potentially big driver of growth ("potentially" because, of course, surveys aren't necessarily representative), it's something we can spend a lot more time studying in the logs.</p>
<h1>End</h1>
<p>To summarize: propensity modeling is a powerful technique for measuring causal effects in the absence of a randomized experiment. </p>
<p>Purely correlational analyses on top of observational studies can be very dangerous, after all. To take my favorite example: if we find that cities with more policemen tend to have more crime, does this mean that we should try to reduce the size of our police forces in order to reduce the nation's amount of crime?</p>
<p>For another example, <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2005/01/07/could_propensit/">here</a>'s a post by Gelman on contradictory conclusions about hormone replacement therapy in the <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2005/01/07/could_propensit/">Harvard Nurses Study</a>.</p>
<p>That said, remember that (as always) a model is only as good as the data that you feed it. It's super difficult to account for all the hidden variables that might matter, and what you think might be a well-designed causal model might well in fact be missing many hidden factors. (I actually remember hearing that a propensity model on the nurses study generated a flawed conclusion, though I can't find any references to this at the moment.) So consider whether there are other approaches you can take, whether it's an easier-to-understand causal technique or even just asking your users, and even if a randomized experiment seems too difficult to run now, the effort may be well worth the trouble in the end.</p>

  <p>One of the magical things about Twitter is that it opens a window to the world in <strong>real-time</strong>. An event happens, and just seconds later, it&#8217;s shared for people across the planet to see.</p>

  <p>Consider, for example, what happened when Flight 1549 crashed in the Hudson.</p>

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="http://twitpic.com/135xa">http://twitpic.com/135xa</a> - There&#8217;s a plane in the Hudson. I&#8217;m on the ferry going to pick up the people. Crazy.</p>&mdash; Janis Krums (@jkrums) <a href="https://twitter.com/jkrums/status/1121915133" data-datetime="2009-01-15T20:36:04+00:00">January 15, 2009</a></blockquote>

  <p>Or when Mitt Romney mentioned binders during the presidential debates.</p>

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Boy, I&#8217;m full of women! <a href="https://twitter.com/search/%23debates">#debates</a></p>&mdash; Romney&#8217;s Binder (@RomneysBinder) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomneysBinder/status/258383626918588417" data-datetime="2012-10-17T01:47:11+00:00">October 17, 2012</a></blockquote>




  <br />


  <p>When each of these events happened, people instantly came to Twitter &#8211; and, in particular, Twitter search &#8211; to discover what was happening.</p>

  <p>From a search and advertising perspective, however, these sudden events pose several challenges:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>The queries people perform have never before been seen, so it&#8217;s impossible to know beforehand what they mean. How would you know that #bindersfullofwomen refers to politics, and not office accessories, or that people searching for &#8220;Horses and Bayonets&#8221; are interested in the debates?</li>
  <li>Since these spikes in search queries are so <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6855">short-lived</a>, there’s only a short window of opportunity to learn what they mean.</li>
  </ol>


  <p>So an event happens, people instantly come to Twitter to search for the event, and we need to teach our systems what these queries mean as quickly as we can, because in just a few hours those searches will be gone.</p>

  <p>How do we do this? We&#8217;ll describe a novel real-time human computation engine we built that allows us to find search queries as soon as they&#8217;re trending, send these queries to real humans to be judged, and finally incorporate these human annotations into our backend models.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Before we dive into the details, here&#8217;s an overview of how the system works.</p>

  <p>(1) First, we monitor for which search queries are currently popular.</p>


  <p>Behind the scenes: we run a Storm topology that tracks statistics on search queries.</p>


  <p>For example: the query &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; may be averaging zero searches a day, but at 6pm on October 3, we suddenly see a spike in searches from the US.</p>




  <p>(2) Next, as soon as we discover a new popular search query, we send it to our human evaluation systems, where judges are asked a variety of questions about the query.</p>


  <p>Behind the scenes: when the Storm topology detects that a query has reached sufficient popularity, it connects to a Thrift API that dispatches the query to Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk service, and then polls Mechanical Turk for a response.</p>


  <p>For example: as soon as we notice &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; spiking, we may ask human judges to categorize the query, or provide other information (e.g., whether there are likely to be interesting pictures of the query, or whether the query is about a person or an event) that helps us serve relevant tweets and ads.</p>


  <p>Finally, after a response from a judge is received, we push the information to our backend systems, so that the next time a user searches for a query, our machine learning models will make use of the additional information. For example, suppose our human judges tell us that &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; is related to politics; the next time someone performs this search, we know to surface ads by @barackobama or @mittromney, not ads about Dora the Explorer.</p>

  <p>Let’s now explore the first two sections above in more detail.</p>

  <h2>Monitoring for popular queries</h2>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm">Storm</a> is a distributed system for real-time computation. In contrast to <em>batch</em> systems like Hadoop, which often introduce delays of hours or more, Storm allows us to run online data processing algorithms to discover search spikes as soon as they happen.</p>

  <p>In brief, running a job on Storm involves creating a Storm topology that describes the processing steps that must occur, and deploying this topology to a Storm cluster. A topology itself consists of three things:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Tuple streams</strong> of data. In our case, these may be tuples of (search query, timestamp).</li>
  <li><strong>Spouts</strong> that produce these tuple streams. In our case, we attach spouts to our search logs, which get written to every time a search occurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Bolts</strong> that process tuple streams. In our case, we use bolts for operations like updating total query counts, filtering out non-English queries, and checking whether an ad is currently being served up for the query.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of how our popular query topology works:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Whenever you perform a search on Twitter, the search request gets logged to a <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka queue</a>.</li>
  <li>The Storm topology attaches a spout to this Kafka queue, and the spout emits a tuple containing the query and other metadata (e.g., the time the query was issued and its location) to a bolt for processing.</li>
  <li>This bolt updates the count of the number of times we&#8217;ve seen this query, checks whether the query is &#8220;currently popular&#8221; (using various statistics like time-decayed counts, the geographic distribution of the query, and the last time this query was sent for annotations), and dispatches it to our human computation pipeline if so.</li>
  </ol>


  <p>One interesting feature of our popularity algorithm is that we often rejudge queries that have been annotated before, since the intent of a search can change. For example, perhaps people normally search for &#8220;Clint Eastwood&#8221; because they&#8217;re interested in his movies, but during the Republican National Convention users may have wanted to see tweets that were more political in nature.</p>

  <h2>Human evaluation of popular search queries</h2>

  <p>At Twitter, we use human computation for a variety of tasks. (See also <a href="https://github.com/twitter/clockworkraven">Clockwork Raven</a>, an open-source crowdsourcing platform we built that makes launching tasks easier.) For example, we often run experiments to measure ad relevance and search quality, we use it to gather data to train and evaluate our machine learning models, and in this section we&#8217;ll describe how we use it to boost our understanding of popular search queries.</p>

  <p>So suppose that our Storm topology has detected that the query &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; is suddenly spiking. Since the query may remain popular for only a few hours, we send it off to live humans, who can help us quickly understand what it means; this dispatch is performed via a Thrift service that allows us to design our tasks in a <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/08/crowdsourced-data-analysis-with.html">web frontend</a>, and later programmatically submit them to crowdsourcing platforms like Mechanical Turk using any of the different languages we use across Twitter.</p>

  <p>On our crowdsourcing platforms, judges are asked several questions about the query that help us serve better ads. Without going into the exact questions, here are flavors of a few possibilities:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>What category does the query belong to? For example, &#8220;Stanford&#8221; may typically be an education-related query, but perhaps there&#8217;s a football game between Stanford and Berkeley at the moment, in which case the current search intent would be sports.</li>
  <li>Does the query refer to a person? If so, who, and what is their Twitter handle if they have one? For example, the query &#8220;Happy Birthday Harry&#8221; may be trending, but it&#8217;s hard to know beforehand which of the numerous celebrities named Harry it&#8217;s referring to. Is it <a href="https://twitter.com/onedirection">One Direction</a>&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/Harry_Styles">Harry Styles</a>, in which case the searcher is likely to be interested in teen pop? Harry Potter, in which case the searcher is likely to be interested in fantasy novels? Or someone else entirely?</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Turkers in the machine</h3>

  <p>Since humans are core to this system, let&#8217;s describe how our workforce was designed to give us fast, reliable results.</p>

  <p>For completing all our tasks, we use a small <em>custom</em> pool of judges to ensure high quality. Other typical possibilities in the crowdsourcing world are to use a static set of in-house judges, to use the standard worker filters that Amazon provides, or to go through an outside company like <a href="http://crowdflower.com/">Crowdflower</a>. We&#8217;ve experimented with these other solutions, and while they have their own benefits, we found that a custom pool fit our needs best for a few reasons:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>In-house judges can provide high-quality work as well, but they usually work standard hours (for example, 9 to 5 if they work onsite, or a relatively fixed and limited set of hours if they work from home), it can be difficult to communicate with them and schedule them for work, and it&#8217;s hard to scale the hiring of more judges.</li>
  <li>Using Crowdflower or Amazon&#8217;s standard filters makes it easy to scale the workforce, but their trust algorithms aren&#8217;t perfect, so an endless problem is that spammy workers get through and many of the judgments will be very poor quality. Two methods of combatting low quality are to seed gold standard examples for which you know the true response throughout your task, or to use statistical analysis to determine which workers are the good ones, but these can be time-consuming and expensive to create, and we often run tasks of a free-response researchy nature for which these solutions don&#8217;t work. Another problem is that using these filters gives you a <em>fluid</em>, constantly changing set of workers, which makes them hard to train.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>In contrast:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Our custom pool of judges work virtually all day. For many of them, this is a full-time job, and they&#8217;re geographically distributed, so our tasks complete quickly at all hours; we can easily ask for thousands of judgments before lunch, and have them finished by the time we get back, which makes iterating on our experiments much easier.</li>
  <li>We have several forums, mailing lists, and even live chatrooms set up, all of which makes it easy for judges to ask us questions and to respond to feedback. Our judges will even give <em>us</em> suggestions on how to improve our tasks; for example, when we run categorization tasks, they&#8217;ll often report helpful categories that we should add.</li>
  <li>Since we only launch tasks on demand, and Amazon provides a ready source of workers if we ever need more, our judges are never idly twiddling their thumbs waiting for tasks or completing busywork, and our jobs are rarely backlogged.</li>
  <li>Because our judges are culled from the best of the crowdsourcing world, they&#8217;re experts at the kinds of tasks we send, and can often provide higher quality at a faster rate than what even in-house judges provide. For example, they&#8217;ll often use the forums and chatrooms to collaborate amongst themselves to give us the best judgments, and they&#8217;re already familiar with the Firefox and Chrome scripts that help them be the most efficient at their work.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>All the benefits described above are especially valuable in this real-time search annotation case:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Having highly trusted workers means we don&#8217;t need to wait for multiple annotations on a single search query to confirm  validity, so we can send responses to our backend as soon as a single judge responds. This entire pipeline is design for <em>real-time</em>, after all, so the lower the latency on the human evaluation part, the better.</li>
  <li>The static nature of our custom pool means that the judges are already familiar with our questions, and don&#8217;t need to be trained again.</li>
  <li>Because our workers aren&#8217;t limited to a fixed schedule or location, they can work anywhere, anytime &#8211; which is a requirement for this system, since global event spikes on Twitter are not beholden to a 9-to-5.</li>
  <li>And with the multiple easy avenues of communication we have set up, it&#8217;s easy for us to answer questions that might arise when we add new questions or modify existing ones.</li>
  </ul>
