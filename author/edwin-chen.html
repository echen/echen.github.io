</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Imagine you're building a recommendation algorithm for your new online site. How do you measure its quality, to make sure that it's sending users relevant and personalized content? Click-through rate may be your initial hope…but after a bit of thought, it's not clear that it's the best metric after all.</p>
<p><strong>Take Google's search engine.</strong> In many cases, improving the quality of search results will <em>decrease</em> CTR! For example, the ideal scenario for queries like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when%20was%20barack%20obama%20born">When was Barack Obama born?</a> is that users never have to click, since the question should be answered on the page itself.</p>
<p><strong>Or take Twitter, who one day might want to recommend you interesting tweets.</strong> Metrics like CTR, or even number of favorites and retweets, will probably optimize for showing quick one-liners and pictures of funny cats. But is a Reddit-like site what Twitter really wants to be? Twitter, for many people, started out as a news site, so users may prefer seeing links to deeper and more interesting content, even if they're less likely to click on each individual suggestion overall.</p>
<p><strong>Or take eBay, who wants to help you find the products you want to buy.</strong> Is CTR a good measure? Perhaps not: more clicks may  be an indication that you're having trouble finding what you're looking for. What about revenue? That might not be ideal either: from the user perspective, you want to make your purchases at the lowest possible price, and by optimizing for revenue, eBay may be turning you towards more expensive products that make you a less frequent customer in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>And so on.</strong></p>
<p>So on many online sites, it's unclear how to measure the quality of personalization and recommendations using metrics like CTR, or revenue, or dwell time, or whatever. What's an engineer to do?</p>
<p>Well, consider the fact that many of these are <em>relevance</em> algorithms. Google wants to show you relevant search results. Twitter wants to show you relevant tweets and ads. Netflix wants to recommend you relevant movies. LinkedIn wants to find you relevant people to follow. <strong>So why, so often, do we never try to measure the relevance of our models?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2013/01/08/improving-twitter-search-with-real-time-human-computation/"><em>man-in-the-machine</em> techniques</a>, so to get around this problem, I'm going to talk about a <strong>human evaluation</strong> approach to measuring the performance of personalization and discovery products. In particular, I'll use the example of related book suggestions on Amazon as I walk through the rest of this post.</p>
<h1>Amazon, and Moving Beyond Log-Based Metrics</h1>
<p>(Let's continue motivating a bit why log-based metrics are often imperfect measures of relevance and quality, as this is an important but difficult-to-understand point.)</p>
<p>So take Amazon's <em>Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought</em> feature, which tries to show you related books.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NoTD5Vk.png"><img alt="Amazon Related Books" src="http://i.imgur.com/NoTD5Vk.png" /></a></p>
<p>To measure its effectiveness, the standard approach is to run a live experiment and measure the change in metrics like revenue or CTR.</p>
<p>But imagine we suddenly replace all of Amazon's book suggestions with pornography. What's going to happen? <a href="http://www.lazygamer.net/general-news/a-history-of-evony-ads-the-insanity-continues/"><em>CTR's likely to shoot through the roof!</em></a></p>
<p>Or suppose that we replace all of Amazon's related books with shinier, more expensive items. Again, CTR and revenue are likely to increase, as the flashier content draws eyeballs. But is this anything but a short-term boost? Perhaps the change decreases total sales in the long run, as customers start to find Amazon too expensive for their tastes and move to other marketplaces.</p>
<p>Scenarios like these are the machine learning analogue of turning ads into blinking marquees. While they might increase clicks and views initially, they're probably not optimizing user happiness or site quality for the future. So how can we avoid them, and ensure that the quality of our suggestions remains consistently high? <strong>This is a <em>related</em> books algorithm, after all – so why, by sticking to a live experiment and metrics like CTR, are we nowhere inspecting the relatedness of our recommendations?</strong></p>
<h1>Human Evaluation</h1>
<p>Solution: let's inject humans into the process. Computers can't measure relatedness (if they could, we'd be done), but people of course can.</p>
<p>For example, in the screenshot below, I asked a worker (on a crowdsourcing platform I've built on my own) to rate the first three <em>Customers Who Bought This Also Bought</em> suggestions for a book on <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/">barnesandnoble.com</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/XBE6tvc.png"><img alt="Fool's Assassin" src="http://i.imgur.com/XBE6tvc.png" /></a></p>
<p>(Copying the text from the screenshot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Fool's Assassin</em>, by Robin Hobb.</strong> (original book) "I only just read this recently, but it's one of my favorites of this year's releases. This book was so beautifully written. I've always been a fan of the Fantasy genre, but often times it's all stylistically similar. Hobb has a wonderful way with characters and narration. The story was absolutely heartbreaking and lead me wanting another book."</li>
<li><strong><em>The Broken Eye (Lightbringer Series #3)</em>, by Brent Weeks.</strong> (first related book) "It's a good, but not great, recommendation. This book sounds interesting enough. It's third in a series though, so I'd have to see how I like the first couple of books first."</li>
<li><strong><em>Dust and Light: A Sanctuary Novel</em>, by Carol Berg.</strong> (second related book) "It's an okay recommendation. I'm not so familiar with this author, but I like some of the premise of the book. I know the saying 'Don't judge a book by its cover...' but the cover art doesn't really appeal to me and kind of turns me off of the book."</li>
<li><strong><em>Tower Lord</em>, by Anthony Ryan.</strong> (third related book) "It's a good, but not great, recommendation. Another completely unfamiliar author to me (kind of like this though, it shows me new places to look for books!) This is also a sequel, though, so I'd have to see how I liked the first book before purchasing this one.")</li>
</ul>
<p>The recommendations are decent, but already we see a couple ways to improve them:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, two of the recommendations (<em>The Broken Eye</em> and <em>Tower Lord</em>) are each part of a series, but not Book #1. So one improvement would be to ensure that only series introductions get displayed unless they're followups to the main book.</li>
<li>Book covers matter! Indeed, the second suggestion looks more like a fantasy romance novel than the kind of fantasy that Robin Hobb tends to write. (So perhaps B&amp;N should invest in some deep learning...)</li>
</ul>
<p>CTR and revenue certainly wouldn't give us this level of information, and it's not clear that they could even tell us our algorithms are producing irrelevant suggestions in the first place. Nowhere does the related scroll panel make it clear that two of the books are part of a series, so the CTR on those two books would be just as high as if they were indeed the series introductions. And if revenue is low, it's not clear whether it's because the suggestions are bad or because, separately, our pricing algorithms need improvement.</p>
<p>So in general, here's one way to understand the quality of a <em>Do This Next</em> algorithm:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a bunch of items (e.g., books if we're Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble), and generate their related brethren.</li>
<li>Send these <item, related items> pairs off to a bunch of judges (say, by using a crowdsourcing platform like <a href="https://www.gethybrid.io">Hybrid</a>), and ask them to rate their relevance.</li>
<li>Analyze the data that comes back.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Algorithmic Relevance on Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Google</h1>
<p>Let's make this process concrete. Pretend I'm a newly minted VP of What Customers Also Buy at Amazon, and I want to understand the product's flaws and stars.</p>
<p>I started by asking a couple hundred of my own human workers to take a book they enjoyed in the past year, and to find it on Amazon. They'd then take the first three related book suggestions from a different author, rate them on the following scale, and explain their ratings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Great suggestion.</strong> I'd definitely buy it. (Very positive)</li>
<li><strong>Decent suggestion.</strong> I might buy it. (Mildly positive)</li>
<li><strong>Not a great suggestion.</strong> I probably wouldn't buy it. (Mildly negative)</li>
<li><strong>Terrible suggestion.</strong> I definitely wouldn't buy it. (Very negative)</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note: I usually prefer a three-point or five-point Likert scale with a "neutral" option, but I was feeling a little wild.)</p>
<p>For example, here's how a rater reviewed the related books for Anne Rice's <em>The Wolves of Midwinter</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eh9VKhR.png"><img alt="Anne Rice" src="http://i.imgur.com/eh9VKhR.png" /></a></p>
<p>So how good are Amazon's recommendations? Quite good, in fact: 47% of raters said they'd definitely buy the first related book, another 29% said it was good enough that they might buy it, and only 24% of raters disliked the suggestion.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/MNSGpIi.png"><img alt="A1 Ratings" src="http://i.imgur.com/MNSGpIi.png" /></a></p>
<p>The second and third book suggestions, while a bit worse, seem to perform pretty well too: around 65% of raters rated them positive.</p>
<p>What can we learn from the bad ratings? I ran a follow-up task that asked workers to categorize the bad related books, and here's the breakdown.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/h4DOvju.png"><img alt="Bad Suggestions Breakdown" src="http://i.imgur.com/h4DOvju.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Related but different-subtopic.</strong> These were book suggestions that were generally related to the original book, but that were in a different sub-topic that the rater wasn't interested in. For example, the first related book for Sun Tzu's <em>The Art of War</em> (a book nominally about war, but which nowadays has become more of a life hack book) was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/On-War-Carl-von-Clausewitz/dp/1469947021"><em>On War</em></a> (a war treatise), but the rater wasn't actually interested in the military aspects: <em>"I would not buy this book, because it only focuses on military war. I am not interested in that. I am interested in mental tactics that will help me prosper in life."</em></li>
<li><strong>Completely unrelated.</strong> These were book suggestions that were completely unrelated to the original book. For example, a Scrabble dictionary appearing on <em>The Art of War</em>'s page.</li>
<li><strong>Uninteresting.</strong> These were suggestions that were related, but whose storylines didn't appeal to the rater. <em>"The storyline doesn't seem that exciting.  I am not a dog fan and it's about a dog."</em></li>
<li><strong>Wrong audience.</strong> These were book suggestions whose target audiences were quite different from the original book's audiences. In many cases, for example, a related book suggestion would be a children's book, but the original book would be geared towards adults. <em>"This seems to be a children's book. If I had a child I would definitely buy this; alas I do not, so I have no need for it."</em></li>
<li><strong>Wrong book type.</strong> Suggestions in this category were items like textbooks or appearing alongside novels.</li>
<li><strong>Disliked author.</strong> These recommendations were by similar authors, but one that the rater disliked. <em>"I do not like Amber Portwood.  I would definitely not want to read a book by and about her."</em></li>
<li><strong>Not first in series.</strong> Some book recommendations would be for an interesting series the rater wasn't familiar with, but they wouldn't be the first book in the series.</li>
<li><strong>Bad rating.</strong> These were book suggestions that had a particularly low Amazon rating.</li>
</ul>
<p>So to improve their recommendations, Amazon could try improving its topic models, add age-based features to its books, distinguish between textbooks and novels, and invest in series detectors. (Of course, for all I know, they do all this already.)</p>
<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
<p>We now have a general grasp of Amazon's related book suggestions and how they could be improved, and just like we could quote a metric like a CTR of 6.2% or whatnot, we can also now quote a <em>relevance score</em> of 0.62 (or whatever). So let's turn to the question of how Amazon compares to other online booksellers like Barnes &amp; Noble and Google Play.</p>
<p>I took the same task I used above, but this time asked raters to review the related suggestions on those two sites as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/kdWcSPs.png"><img alt="Amazon vs. B&amp;N vs. Google" src="http://i.imgur.com/kdWcSPs.png" /></a></p>
<p>In short,</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barnes &amp; Nobles's algorithm are almost as good as Amazon's</strong>: the first three suggestions were rated positive 58% of the time, compared to 68% on Amazon.</li>
<li><strong>But Play Store recommendations are atrocious</strong> : a whopping 51% of Google's related book recommendations were marked terrible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why are the Play Store's suggestions so bad? Let's look at a couple examples.</p>
<p>Here's the Play Store page for John Green's <em>The Fault in Our Stars</em>, a critics-loved-it book about cancer and romance (and now also a movie).</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/oYKFLeV.png"><img alt="Fault in Our Stars" src="http://i.imgur.com/oYKFLeV.png" /></a></p>
<p>Two of the suggestions are completely random: a poorly-rated Excel manual and a poorly-reviewed textbook on sexual health. The others are completely unrelated cowboy books, by a different John Green.</p>
<p>Here's the page for <em>The Strain</em>. In this case, all the suggestions are in a different language! And there are only four of them.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/F1XNxPz.png"><img alt="The Strain" src="http://i.imgur.com/F1XNxPz.png" /></a></p>
<p>Once again asking raters to categorize all of the Play Store's bad recommendations...</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/1rWRQ0r.png"><img alt="Google Atrocity" src="http://i.imgur.com/1rWRQ0r.png" /></a></p>
<ul>
<li>45% of the time, the related book suggestions were completely unrelated to the original book in question. For example: displaying a physics textbook on the page for a romance novel.</li>
<li>32% of the time, there simply wasn't a book suggestion at all. (I'm guessing the Play Bookstore's catalog is pretty limited.)</li>
<li>14% of the time, the related books were in a different language.</li>
</ul>
<p>So despite Google's state-of-the-art machine learning elsewhere, its Play Store suggestions couldn't really get much worse.</p>
<h1>Side-by-Sides</h1>
<p>Let's step back a bit. So far I've been focusing on an <em>absolute</em> judgments paradigm, in which judges rate how relevant a book is to the original on an absolute scale. This model is great for understanding the overall quality of Amazon's related book algorithm.</p>
<p>In many cases, though, we want to use human evaluation to <em>compare</em> experiments. For example, it's common at many companies to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Launch a "human evaluation A/B test" before a live experiment, both to avoid accidentally sending out incredibly buggy experiments to users, as well as to avoid the long wait required in live tests.</li>
<li>Use a human-generated relevance score as a supplement to live experiment metrics when making launch decisions.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these kinds of tasks, what's preferable is often a <em>side-by-side</em> model, wherein judges are given two items and asked which one is better. After all, comparative judgments are often much easier to make than absolute ones, and we might want to detect differences at a finer level than what's available on an absolute scale.</p>
<p>The idea is that we can assign a score to each rating (negative, say, if the rater prefers the control item; positive if the rater prefers the experiment), and we aggregate these to form an overall score for the side-by-side. Then in much the same way that drops in CTR may block an experiment launch, a negative human evaluation score should also give much cause for concern.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I don't have an easy way to generate data for a side-by-side (though I could perform a side-by-side on Amazon vs. Barnes &amp; Noble), so I'll omit an example, but the idea should be pretty clear.</p>
<h1>Personalization</h1>
<p>Here's another subtlety. In my examples above, I asked raters to pick a starting book themselves (one that they read and loved in the past year), and then rate whether they personally would want to read the related suggestions.</p>
<p>Another approach is to pick the starting books <em>for</em> the raters, and then have the rate the related suggestions more objectively, by trying to put themselves in the shoes of someone who'd be interested in the starting item.</p>
<p>Which approach is better? As you can probably guess, there's no clear answer – it depends on the task and goals at hand.</p>
<p>Pros of the first approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's much more nuanced. It can often be hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes: would someone reading Harry Potter be interested in Twilight? On the one hand, they're both fantasy books; on the other hand, Twilight seems a bit more geared towards female audiences.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pros of the second approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes, objectivity is a good thing. (Should you really care if someone dislikes Twilight simply because Edward reminds her of her boyfriend?)</li>
<li>Allowing people to choose their starting items may bias certain metrics. For instance, people are much more likely to choose popular books to rate, whereas we might want to measure the quality of Amazon's suggestions across a broader, more representative slice of its catalog.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Recap</h1>
<p>Let's review what I've discussed so far.</p>
<ol>
<li>Online, log-based metrics like CTR and revenue aren't necessarily the best measures of a discovery algorithm's quality. Items with high CTR, for example, may simply be racy and flashy, not the most relevant.</li>
<li>So instead of relying on these proxies, let's directly measure the relevance of our recommendations by asking a pool of human raters.</li>
<li>There are a couple different approaches for sending which items to be judged. We can let the raters choose the items (an approach which is often necessary for personalized algorithms), or we can generate the items ourselves (often useful for more objective tasks like search; this also has the benefit of making it easier to derive popularity-weighted or uniformly-weighted metrics of relevance). We can also take an absolute judgment approach, or use side-by-sides.</li>
<li>By analyzing the data from our evaluations, we can make better launch decisions, discover examples where our algorithms do very well or very poorly, and find patterns for improvement.</li>
</ol>
<p>What are some of the benefits and applications?  </p>
<ol>
<li>As mentioned, log-based metrics like CTR and revenue don't always capture the signals we want, so human-generated scores of relevance (or other dimensions) are useful complements.</li>
<li>Human evaluations can make iteration quicker and easier. A algorithm change might normally require weeks of live testing before we gather enough data to know how it affects users, but we can easily have a task judged by humans in a couple hours.</li>
<li>Imagine we're an advertising company, and we choose which ads to show based on a combination of CTR and revenue. Once we gather hundreds of thousands of relevance judgments from our evaluations, we can build a <em>relevance</em>-based machine learning model to add to the mix, thereby injecting a more direct measure of quality into the system.</li>
<li>How can we decide what improvements need to be made to our models? Evaluations give us very concrete feedback and specific examples about what's working and what's wrong.</li>
</ol>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>Imagine you just started a job at a new company. You watched <a href="http://youtu.be/AcNK7M2eCI4?t=1m5s">World War Z</a> recently, so you're in a skeptical mood, and given that your last two startups failed from what you believe to be a lack of data, you're giving everything an extra critical eye.</p>
<p>You start by thinking about the impact of the sales team. <em>How much extra revenue are they generating for the company?</em> The sales folks you've met say that over 90% of the leads they've talked to end up buying the company's product – but, you wonder, how many of those leads would have converted anyways?</p>
<p>You take a look at the logs, and notice something interesting: last week was hack week, and half the salesforce took time off from making calls to make Marauder's Maps instead, yet the rate of converted leads remained the same...*</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of your teammates drops by your desk. He's making a batch of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/29/technology/personaltech/the-soylent-revolution-will-not-be-pleasurable.html">Soylent</a>, and he wants you to take a sip. It looks nasty, so you ask what the benefits are, and he responds that his friends who've been drinking it for the past few months just ran a marathon! <em>Oh, did they just start running?</em> Nope, they ran the marathon last year too!...</p>
<p>*Inspired by a true story.</p>
<h1>Causal Inference</h1>
<p>Causality is incredibly important, yet often extremely difficult to establish.</p>
<p>Do patients who self-select into taking a new drug get better <em>because</em> the drug works, or would they have gotten better anyways? Is your salesforce actually effective, or are they simply talking to the customers who already plan to convert? Is Soylent (or your company's million-dollar ad campaign) truly worth your time?</p>
<p>In an ideal world, we'd be able to run experiments – the gold standard for measuring causality – whenever we wish. In the real world, however, we can't. There are ethical qualms with giving certain patients placebos, or dangerous and untested drugs. Management may be unwilling to take a potential short-term revenue hit by assigning sales to random customers, and a team earning commission-based bonuses may rebel against the thought as well.</p>
<p>How can we understand causal lifts in the absence of an A/B test? This is where propensity modeling, or other techniques of causal inference, comes into play.</p>
<h1>Propensity Modeling</h1>
<p>So suppose we want to model the effect of drinking Soylent using a propensity model technique. To explain the idea, let's start with a thought experiment. </p>
<p>Imagine Brad Pitt has a twin brother, indistinguishable in every way: Brad 1 and Brad 2 wake up at the same time, they eat the same foods, they exercise the same amount, and so on. One day, Brad 1 happens to receive the last batch of Soylent from a marketer on the street, while Brad 2 does not, and so only Brad 1 begins to incorporate Soylent into his diet. In this scenario, any subsequent difference in behavior between the twins is precisely the drink's effect.</p>
<p>Taking this scenario into the real world, one way to estimate the Soylent's effect on health would be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>For every Soylent drinker, find a Soylent abstainer who's as close a match as possible. For example, we might match a Soylent-drinking Jay-Z with a non-Soylent Kanye, a Soylent-drinking Natalie Portman with a non-Soylent Keira Knightley, and a Soylent-drinking JK Rowling with a non-Soylent Stephenie Meyer.</li>
<li>We measure Soylent's effect as the difference between each twin pair.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, finding closely matching twins is extremely difficult in practice. Is Jay-Z really a close match with Kanye, if Jay-Z sleeps one hour more on average? What about the Jonas Brothers and One Direction?</p>
<p><strong>Propensity modeling</strong>, then, is a simplification of this twin matching procedure. Instead of matching pairs of people based on all the variables we have, we simply match all users based on a single number, the likelihood ("propensity") that they'll start to drink Soylent.</p>
<p>In more detail, here's how to build a propensity model.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, select which variables to use as features. (e.g., what foods people eat, when they sleep, where they live, etc.)</li>
<li>Next, build a probabilistic model (say, a logistic regression) based on these variables to predict whether a user will start drinking Soylent or not. For example, our training set might consist of a set of people, some of whom ordered Soylent in the first week of March 2014, and we would train the classifier to model which users become the Soylent users.</li>
<li>The model's probabilistic estimate that a user will start drinking Soylent is called a <strong>propensity score</strong>.</li>
<li>Form some number of buckets, say 10 buckets in total (one bucket covers users with a 0.0 - 0.1 propensity to take the drink, a second bucket covers users with a 0.1 - 0.2 propensity, and so on), and place people into each one.</li>
<li>Finally, compare the drinkers and non-drinkers within each bucket (say, by measuring their subsequent physical activity, weight, or whatever measure of health) to estimate Soylent's causal effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here's a hypothetical distribution of Soylent and non-Soylent ages. We see that drinkers tend to be quite a bit older, and this confounding fact is one reason we can't simply run a correlational analysis.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vQQACqf.png"><img alt="Age Distribution" src="http://i.imgur.com/vQQACqf.png" /></a></p>
<p>After training a model to estimate Soylent propensity and group users into propensity buckets, this might be a graph of the effect that Soylent has on a person's weekly running mileage.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/GwxpWve.png"><img alt="Soylent Effect" src="http://i.imgur.com/GwxpWve.png" /></a></p>
<p>In the above (hypothetical) graph, each row represents a propensity bucket of people, and the exposure week denotes the first week of March, when the treatment group received their Soylent shipment. We see that prior to that week, both groups of people track quite well. After the treatment group (the Soylent drinkers) start their plan, however, their weekly running mileage ramps up, which forms our estimate of the drink's causal effect.</p>
<h1>Other Methods of Causal Inference</h1>
<p>Of course, there are many other methods of causal inference on observational data. I'll run through two of my favorites. (I originally wrote this post in response to a question on Quora, which is why I take my examples from there.)</p>
<h2>Regression Discontinuity</h2>
<p>Quora recently started displaying badges of status on the profiles of its <a href="http://blog.quora.com/Announcing-Top-Writers-2013">Top Writers</a>, so suppose we want to understand the effect of this feature. (Assume that it's impossible to run an A/B test now that the feature has been launched.) Specifically, does the badge itself cause users to gain more followers?</p>
<p>For simplicity, let's assume that the badge was given to all users who received at least 5000 upvotes in 2013. The idea behind a <strong>regression discontinuity design</strong> is that the difference between those users who just barely receive a Top Writer badge (i.e., receive 5000 upvotes) and those who just barely don't (i.e., receive 4999 upvotes) is more or less random chance, so we can use this threshold to estimate a causal effect.</p>
<p>For example, in the imaginary graph below, the discontinuity at 5000 upvotes suggests that a Top Writer badge leads to around 100 more followers on average.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/7Mprryq.png"><img alt="Regression Discontinuity" src="http://i.imgur.com/7Mprryq.png" /></a></p>
<h2>Natural Experiments</h2>
<p>Understanding the effect of a Top Writer badge is a fairly uninteresting question, though. (It just makes an easy example.) A deeper, more fundamental question could be to ask: what happens when a user discovers a new writer that they love? Does the writer inspire them to write some of their own content, to explore more of the same topics, and through curation lead them to engage with the site even more? How important, in other words, is the connection to a great <em>user</em> as opposed to the reading of random, great <em>posts</em>?</p>
<p>I studied an analogous question when I was at Google, so instead of making up an imaginary Quora case study, I'll describe some of that work here.</p>
<p>So let's suppose we want to understand what would happen if we were able to match users to the perfect YouTube channel. How much is the ultimate recommendation worth?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does falling in love with a new channel lead to engagement above and beyond activity on the channel itself, perhaps because users return to YouTube specifically for the new channel and stay to watch more? (a <strong>multiplicative</strong> effect) In the TV world, for example, perhaps many people stay at home on Sunday nights <em>specifically</em> to catch the latest episode of Real Housewives, and channel surf for even more entertainment once it's over.</li>
<li>Does falling in love with a new channel simply increase activity on the channel alone? (an <strong>additive</strong> effect)</li>
<li>Does a new channel replace existing engagement on YouTube? After all, maybe users only have a limited amount of time they can spend on the site. (a <strong>neutral</strong> effect)</li>
<li>Does the perfect channel actually cause users to spend less time overall on the site, since maybe they spend less time idly browsing and channel surfing once they have concrete channels they know how to turn to? (a <strong>negative</strong> effect)</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, an A/B test would be ideal, but it's impossible in this case to run: we can't force users to fall in love with a channel (we can recommend them channels, but there's no guarantee they'll actually like them), and we can't forcibly block them from certain channels either.</p>
<p>One approach is to use a <strong>natural experiment</strong> (a scenario in which the universe itself somehow generates a random-like assignment) to study this effect. Here's the idea.</p>
<p>Consider a user who uploads a new video every Wednesday. One month, he lets his subscribers know that he won’t be uploading any new videos for a few weeks, while he goes on vacation.</p>
<p>How do his subscribers respond? Do they stop watching YouTube on Wednesdays, since his channel was the sole reason for their visits? Or is their activity relatively unaffected, since they only watch his content when it appears on the front page?</p>
<p>Imagine, instead, that the channel starts uploading a new video every Friday. Do his subscribers start to visit then as well? And now that they're on YouTube, do they merely stay for the new video, or does their visit lead to a sinkhole of searches and related content too?</p>
<p>As it turns out, these scenarios do happen. For example, here's a calendar of when one popular channel uploads videos. You can see that in 2011, it tended to upload videos on Tuesdays and Fridays, but it shifted to uploads on Wednesday and Saturday at the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/wCiHHAD.png"><img alt="Uploads Calendar" src="http://i.imgur.com/wCiHHAD.png" /></a></p>
<p>By using this shift as natural experiment that "quasi-randomly" removes a well-loved channel on certain days and introduces it on others, we can try to understand the effect of successfully making the perfect recommendation.</p>
<p>(This is probably a somewhat convoluted example of a natural experiment. For an example that perhaps illustrates the idea more clearly, suppose we want to understand the effect of income on mental health. We can't force some people to become poor or rich, and a correlational study is clearly flawed. <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/01/18/what-happens-when-the-poor-receive-a-stipend/">This NY Times article</a> describes a natural experiment when a group of Cherokee Indians distributed casino profits to its members, thereby "randomly" lifting some of them out of poverty.</p>
<p>Another example, assuming there's nothing special about the period in which hack week occurs, is the use of hack week as an instrument that quasi-randomly "prevents" the sales team from doing their job, as in the scenario I described above.)</p>
<h1>Discovering Drivers of Growth</h1>
<p>Let's go back to propensity modeling.</p>
<p>Imagine that we're on our company's Growth team, and we're tasked with figuring out how to turn casual users of the site into users that return every day. What do we do?</p>
<p>The propensity modeling approach might be the following. We could take a list of features (installing the mobile app, logging in, signing up for a newsletter, following certain users, etc.), and build a propensity model for each one. We could then rank each feature by its estimated causal effect on engagement, and use the ordered list of features to prioritize our next sprint. (Or we could use these numbers in order to convince the exec team that we need more resources.) This is a slightly more sophisticated version of the idea of building an engagement regression model (or a churn regression model), and examining the weights on each feature.</p>
<p>Despite writing this post, though, I admit I'm generally not a fan of propensity modeling for many applications in the tech world. (I haven't worked in the medical field, so I don't have a strong opinion on its usefulness there, though I think it's a little more necessary there.) I'll save more of my reasons for another time, but after all, causal inference is extremely difficult, and we're never going to be able to control for all the hidden influencers that can bias a treatment. Also, the mere fact that we have to choose which features to include in our model (and remember: building features is very time-consuming and difficult) means that we already have a strong prior belief on the usefulness of each feature, whereas what we'd really like to do is to discover hidden motivations of engagement that we've never thought of.</p>
<p>So what can we do instead?</p>
<p><strong>If we're trying to understand what drives people to become heavy users of the site, why don't we simply ask them?</strong></p>
<p>In more detail, let's do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, we'll run a survey on a couple hundred of users.</li>
<li>In the survey, we'll ask them whether their engagement on the site has increased, decreased, or remained about the same over the past year. We'll also ask them to explain possible reasons for their change in activity, and to describe how they use the site currently. We can also ask for supplemental details, like their demographic information.</li>
<li>Finally, we can filter all responses for those users who heavily increased their engagement over the past year (or who heavily decreased it, if we're trying to understand churn), and analyse their responses for the reasons.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, here's one interesting response I got when I ran this study at YouTube.</p>
<p><em>"I have always been a big music fan, but recently I took up playing the guitar. Because of my new found passion (playing the guitar) my desire to watch concerts has increased. I started watching a whole lot of music festivals and concerts that are posted on Youtube and other music videos. I have spent a lot of time also watching guitar lessons on Youtube (from www.justinguitar.com)."</em></p>
<p>This response was representative of a general theme the survey uncovered: one big driver of engagement seemed to come from people discovering a new offline hobby, and using YouTube to increase their appreciation of it. People who wanted to start cooking at home would turn to YouTube for recipe videos, people who started playing tennis or some other sport would go to YouTube for lessons or other great shots, college students would look for channels like Khan Academy to supplement their lectures, and so on. In other words, offline activities were driving online growth, and instead of trying to figure out what kinds of <em>online</em> content people were interested in (which articles did they like on Facebook, who did they follow on Twitter, what did they read on Reddit), perhaps we should have been focusing on bringing their physical hobbies into the digital world.</p>
<p>This "offline hobby" idea certainly wouldn't have been a feature I would have thrown into any engagement model, even if only because it's a very difficult feature to create. (How do we know which videos are related to real-world behavior?) But now that we suspect it's a potentially big driver of growth ("potentially" because, of course, surveys aren't necessarily representative), it's something we can spend a lot more time studying in the logs.</p>
<h1>End</h1>
<p>To summarize: propensity modeling is a powerful technique for measuring causal effects in the absence of a randomized experiment. </p>
<p>Purely correlational analyses on top of observational studies can be very dangerous, after all. To take my favorite example: if we find that cities with more policemen tend to have more crime, does this mean that we should try to reduce the size of our police forces in order to reduce the nation's amount of crime?</p>
<p>For another example, <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2005/01/07/could_propensit/">here</a>'s a post by Gelman on contradictory conclusions about hormone replacement therapy in the <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2005/01/07/could_propensit/">Harvard Nurses Study</a>.</p>
<p>That said, remember that (as always) a model is only as good as the data that you feed it. It's super difficult to account for all the hidden variables that might matter, and what you think might be a well-designed causal model might well in fact be missing many hidden factors. (I actually remember hearing that a propensity model on the nurses study generated a flawed conclusion, though I can't find any references to this at the moment.) So consider whether there are other approaches you can take, whether it's an easier-to-understand causal technique or even just asking your users, and even if a randomized experiment seems too difficult to run now, the effort may be well worth the trouble in the end.</p>

  <br />


  <p>When each of these events happened, people instantly came to Twitter &#8211; and, in particular, Twitter search &#8211; to discover what was happening.</p>

  <p>From a search and advertising perspective, however, these sudden events pose several challenges:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>The queries people perform have never before been seen, so it&#8217;s impossible to know beforehand what they mean. How would you know that #bindersfullofwomen refers to politics, and not office accessories, or that people searching for &#8220;Horses and Bayonets&#8221; are interested in the debates?</li>
  <li>Since these spikes in search queries are so <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6855">short-lived</a>, there’s only a short window of opportunity to learn what they mean.</li>
  </ol>


  <p>So an event happens, people instantly come to Twitter to search for the event, and we need to teach our systems what these queries mean as quickly as we can, because in just a few hours those searches will be gone.</p>

  <p>How do we do this? We&#8217;ll describe a novel real-time human computation engine we built that allows us to find search queries as soon as they&#8217;re trending, send these queries to real humans to be judged, and finally incorporate these human annotations into our backend models.</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>Before we delve into the details, here&#8217;s an overview of how the system works.</p>

  <p>(1) First, we monitor for which search queries are currently popular.</p>


  <p>Behind the scenes: we run a Storm topology that tracks statistics on search queries.</p>


  <p>For example: the query &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; may be averaging zero searches a day, but at 6pm on October 3, we suddenly see a spike in searches from the US.</p>




  <p>(2) Next, as soon as we discover a new popular search query, we send it to our human evaluation systems, where judges are asked a variety of questions about the query.</p>


  <p>Behind the scenes: when the Storm topology detects that a query has reached sufficient popularity, it connects to a Thrift API that dispatches the query to Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk service, and then polls Mechanical Turk for a response.</p>


  <p>For example: as soon as we notice &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; spiking, we may ask human judges to categorize the query, or provide other information (e.g., whether there are likely to be interesting pictures of the query, or whether the query is about a person or an event) that helps us serve relevant tweets and ads.</p>


  <p>Finally, after a response from a judge is received, we push the information to our backend systems, so that the next time a user searches for a query, our machine learning models will make use of the additional information. For example, suppose our human judges tell us that &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; is related to politics; the next time someone performs this search, we know to surface ads by @barackobama or @mittromney, not ads about Dora the Explorer.</p>

  <p>Let’s now explore the first two sections above in more detail.</p>

  <h2>Monitoring for popular queries</h2>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm">Storm</a> is a distributed system for real-time computation. In contrast to <em>batch</em> systems like Hadoop, which often introduce delays of hours or more, Storm allows us to run online data processing algorithms to discover search spikes as soon as they happen.</p>

  <p>In brief, running a job on Storm involves creating a Storm topology that describes the processing steps that must occur, and deploying this topology to a Storm cluster. A topology itself consists of three things:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Tuple streams</strong> of data. In our case, these may be tuples of (search query, timestamp).</li>
  <li><strong>Spouts</strong> that produce these tuple streams. In our case, we attach spouts to our search logs, which get written to every time a search occurs.</li>
  <li><strong>Bolts</strong> that process tuple streams. In our case, we use bolts for operations like updating total query counts, filtering out non-English queries, and checking whether an ad is currently being served up for the query.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Here’s a step-by-step walkthrough of how our popular query topology works:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Whenever you perform a search on Twitter, the search request gets logged to a <a href="http://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka queue</a>.</li>
  <li>The Storm topology attaches a spout to this Kafka queue, and the spout emits a tuple containing the query and other metadata (e.g., the time the query was issued and its location) to a bolt for processing.</li>
  <li>This bolt updates the count of the number of times we&#8217;ve seen this query, checks whether the query is &#8220;currently popular&#8221; (using various statistics like time-decayed counts, the geographic distribution of the query, and the last time this query was sent for annotations), and dispatches it to our human computation pipeline if so.</li>
  </ol>


  <p>One interesting feature of our popularity algorithm is that we often rejudge queries that have been annotated before, since the intent of a search can change. For example, perhaps people normally search for &#8220;Clint Eastwood&#8221; because they&#8217;re interested in his movies, but during the Republican National Convention users may have wanted to see tweets that were more political in nature.</p>

  <h2>Human evaluation of popular search queries</h2>

  <p>At Twitter, we use human computation for a variety of tasks. (See also <a href="https://github.com/twitter/clockworkraven">Clockwork Raven</a>, an open-source crowdsourcing platform we built that makes launching tasks easier.) For example, we often run experiments to measure ad relevance and search quality, we use it to gather data to train and evaluate our machine learning models, and in this section we&#8217;ll describe how we use it to boost our understanding of popular search queries.</p>

  <p>So suppose that our Storm topology has detected that the query &#8220;Big Bird&#8221; is suddenly spiking. Since the query may remain popular for only a few hours, we send it off to live humans, who can help us quickly understand what it means; this dispatch is performed via a Thrift service that allows us to design our tasks in a <a href="http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/08/crowdsourced-data-analysis-with.html">web frontend</a>, and later programmatically submit them to crowdsourcing platforms like Mechanical Turk using any of the different languages we use across Twitter.</p>

  <p>On our crowdsourcing platforms, judges are asked several questions about the query that help us serve better ads. Without going into the exact questions, here are flavors of a few possibilities:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>What category does the query belong to? For example, &#8220;Stanford&#8221; may typically be an education-related query, but perhaps there&#8217;s a football game between Stanford and Berkeley at the moment, in which case the current search intent would be sports.</li>
  <li>Does the query refer to a person? If so, who, and what is their Twitter handle if they have one? For example, the query &#8220;Happy Birthday Harry&#8221; may be trending, but it&#8217;s hard to know beforehand which of the numerous celebrities named Harry it&#8217;s referring to. Is it <a href="https://twitter.com/onedirection">One Direction</a>&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/Harry_Styles">Harry Styles</a>, in which case the searcher is likely to be interested in teen pop? Harry Potter, in which case the searcher is likely to be interested in fantasy novels? Or someone else entirely?</li>
  </ul>


  <h3>Turkers in the machine</h3>

  <p>Since humans are core to this system, let&#8217;s describe how our workforce was designed to give us fast, reliable results.</p>

  <p>For completing all our tasks, we use a small <em>custom</em> pool of judges to ensure high quality. Other typical possibilities in the crowdsourcing world are to use a static set of in-house judges, to use the standard worker filters that Amazon provides, or to go through an outside company like <a href="http://crowdflower.com/">Crowdflower</a>. We&#8217;ve experimented with these other solutions, and while they have their own benefits, we found that a custom pool fit our needs best for a few reasons:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>In-house judges can provide high-quality work as well, but they usually work standard hours (for example, 9 to 5 if they work onsite, or a relatively fixed and limited set of hours if they work from home), it can be difficult to communicate with them and schedule them for work, and it&#8217;s hard to scale the hiring of more judges.</li>
  <li>Using Crowdflower or Amazon&#8217;s standard filters makes it easy to scale the workforce, but their trust algorithms aren&#8217;t perfect, so an endless problem is that spammy workers get through and many of the judgments will be very poor quality. Two methods of combatting low quality are to seed gold standard examples for which you know the true response throughout your task, or to use statistical analysis to determine which workers are the good ones, but these can be time-consuming and expensive to create, and we often run tasks of a free-response researchy nature for which these solutions don&#8217;t work. Another problem is that using these filters gives you a <em>fluid</em>, constantly changing set of workers, which makes them hard to train.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>In contrast:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Our custom pool of judges work virtually all day. For many of them, this is a full-time job, and they&#8217;re geographically distributed, so our tasks complete quickly at all hours; we can easily ask for thousands of judgments before lunch, and have them finished by the time we get back, which makes iterating on our experiments much easier.</li>
  <li>We have several forums, mailing lists, and even live chatrooms set up, all of which makes it easy for judges to ask us questions and to respond to feedback. Our judges will even give <em>us</em> suggestions on how to improve our tasks; for example, when we run categorization tasks, they&#8217;ll often report helpful categories that we should add.</li>
  <li>Since we only launch tasks on demand, and Amazon provides a ready source of workers if we ever need more, our judges are never idly twiddling their thumbs waiting for tasks or completing busywork, and our jobs are rarely backlogged.</li>
  <li>Because our judges are culled from the best of the crowdsourcing world, they&#8217;re experts at the kinds of tasks we send, and can often provide higher quality at a faster rate than what even in-house judges provide. For example, they&#8217;ll often use the forums and chatrooms to collaborate amongst themselves to give us the best judgments, and they&#8217;re already familiar with the Firefox and Chrome scripts that help them be the most efficient at their work.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>All the benefits described above are especially valuable in this real-time search annotation case:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Having highly trusted workers means we don&#8217;t need to wait for multiple annotations on a single search query to confirm  validity, so we can send responses to our backend as soon as a single judge responds. This entire pipeline is design for <em>real-time</em>, after all, so the lower the latency on the human evaluation part, the better.</li>
  <li>The static nature of our custom pool means that the judges are already familiar with our questions, and don&#8217;t need to be trained again.</li>
  <li>Because our workers aren&#8217;t limited to a fixed schedule or location, they can work anywhere, anytime &#8211; which is a requirement for this system, since global event spikes on Twitter are not beholden to a 9-to-5.</li>
  <li>And with the multiple easy avenues of communication we have set up, it&#8217;s easy for us to answer questions that might arise when we add new questions or modify existing ones.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Thanks to everyone on the Revenue and Storm teams, as well as our Turkers, for helping us launch this project.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info -->
  <div class="entry-content"><p>A couple weeks ago, Facebook launched a <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/FacebookRecruiting/">link prediction contest</a> on Kaggle, with the goal of recommending missing edges in a social graph. <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/09/07/information-transmission-in-a-social-network-dissecting-the-spread-of-a-quora-post/">I love investigating social networks</a>, so I dug around a little, and since I did well enough to score one of the coveted prizes, I&#8217;ll share my approach here.</p>

  <p>(For some background, the contest provided a training dataset of edges, a test set of nodes, and contestants were asked to predict missing outbound edges on the test set, using mean average precision as the evaluation metric.)</p>

  <h1>Exploration</h1>

  <p>What does the network look like? I wanted to play around with the data a bit first just to get a rough feel, so I made an <a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/network">app</a> to interact with the network around each node.</p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s a sample:</p>

  <p><a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/network"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/L2S5GC1.png" alt="1 Untrimmed Network" /></a></p>

  <p>(Go ahead, click on the picture to <a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/network">play with the app yourself</a>. It&#8217;s pretty fun.)</p>

  <p>The node in black is a selected node from the training set, and we perform a breadth-first walk of the graph out to a maximum distance of 3 to uncover the local network. Nodes are sized according to their distance from the center, and colored according to a chosen metric (a personalized PageRank in this case; more on this later).</p>

  <p>We can see that the central node is friends with three other users (in red), two of whom have fairly large, disjoint networks.</p>

  <p>There are quite a few dangling nodes (nodes at distance 3 with only one connection to the rest of the local network), though, so let&#8217;s remove these to reveal the core structure:</p>

  <p><a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/network"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/w1kAj6x.png" alt="1 Untrimmed Network" /></a></p>

  <p>And here&#8217;s an embedded version you can manipulate inline:</p>

  <iframe width="600px" height="500px" src="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/network?for_embed=true"></iframe>


  <p>Since the default view doesn&#8217;t encode the distinction between following and follower relationships, we can mouse over each node to see who it follows and who it&#8217;s followed by. Here, for example, is the following/follower network of one of the central node&#8217;s friends:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/38laphs.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/38laphs.png" alt="1 - Friend1" /></a></p>

  <p>The moused over node is highlighted in black, its friends (users who both follow the node and are followed back in turn) are colored in purple, its followees are teal, and its followers in orange. We can also see that the node shares a friend with the central user (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadic_closure">triadic closure</a>, <em>holla!</em>).</p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s another network, this time of the friend at the bottom:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/bmJdrGT.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/bmJdrGT.png" alt="1 - Friend2" /></a></p>

  <p>Interestingly, while the first friend had several only-followers (in orange), the second friend has none. (which suggests, perhaps, a node-level feature that measures how follow-hungry a user is&#8230;)</p>

  <p>And here&#8217;s one more node, a little further out (maybe a celebrity, given it has nothing but followers?):</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/vXXT1np.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/vXXT1np.png" alt="1 - Celebrity" /></a></p>

  <h2>The Quiet One</h2>

  <p>Let&#8217;s take a look at another graph, one whose local network is a little smaller:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YDjamZK.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/YDjamZK.png" alt="4 Network" /></a></p>

  <h2>A Social Butterfly</h2>

  <p>And one more, whose local network is a little larger:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/0dPnb3V.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0dPnb3V.png" alt="2 Network" /></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/RSS8Ikh.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/RSS8Ikh.png" alt="2 Network - Friend" /></a></p>

  <p>Again, I encourage everyone to play around with the app <a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/network">here</a>, and I&#8217;ll come back to the question of coloring each node later.</p>

  <h1>Distributions</h1>

  <p>Next, let&#8217;s take a more quantitative look at the graph.</p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s the distribution of the number of followers of each node in the training set (cut off at 50 followers for a better fit &#8211; the maximum number of followers is 552), as well as the number of users each node is following (again, cut off at 50 &#8211; the maximum here is 1566)</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/c5BfwaG.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/c5BfwaG.png" alt="Training Followers" /></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/NLBHgy8.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/NLBHgy8.png" alt="Training Followees" /></a></p>

  <p>Nothing terribly surprising, but that alone is good to verify. (For people tempted to mutter about power laws, I&#8217;ll hold you off with the bitter coldness of <a href="http://cscs.umich.edu/~crshalizi/weblog/491.html">baby Gauss&#8217;s tears</a>.)</p>

  <p>Similarly, here are the same two graphs, but limited to the nodes in the test set alone:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/O6ogEYy.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/O6ogEYy.png" alt="Test Followers" /></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/roUrV5I.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/roUrV5I.png" alt="Test Followees" /></a></p>

  <p>Notice that there are relatively more test set users with 0 followees than in the full training set, and relatively fewer test set users with 0 followers. This information could be used to better simulate a validation set for model selection, though I didn&#8217;t end up doing this myself.</p>

  <h1>Preliminary Probes</h1>

  <p>Finally, let&#8217;s move on to the models themselves.</p>

  <p>In order to quickly get up and running on a couple prediction algorithms, I started with some unsupervised approaches. For example, after building a new validation set* to test performance offline, I tried:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Recommending users who follow you (but you don&#8217;t follow in return)</li>
  <li>Recommending users similar to you (when representing users as sets of their followers, and using cosine similarity and Jaccard similarity as the similarity metric)</li>
  <li>Recommending users based on a personalized PageRank score</li>
  <li>Recommending users that the people you follow also follow</li>
  </ul>


  <p>And so on, combining the votes of these algorithms in a fairly ad-hoc way (e.g., by taking the majority vote or by ordering by the number of followers).</p>

  <p>This worked quite well actually, but I&#8217;d been planning to move on to a more machine learned model-based approach from the beginning, so I did that next.</p>

  <p>*My validation set was formed by deleting random edges from the full training set. A slightly better approach, as mentioned above, might have been to more accurately simulate the distribution of the official test set, but I didn&#8217;t end up trying this out myself.</p>

  <h1>Candidate Selection</h1>

  <p>In order to run a machine learning algorithm to recommend edges (which would take two nodes, a source and a candidate destination, and generate a score measuring the likelihood that the source would follow the destination), it&#8217;s necessary to prune the set of candidates to run the algorithm on.</p>

  <p>I used two approaches for this filtering step, both based on random walks on the graph.</p>

  <h2>Personalized PageRank</h2>

  <p>The first approach was to calculate a personalized PageRank around each source node.</p>

  <p>Briefly, a personalized PageRank is like standard PageRank, except that when randomly teleporting to a new node, the surfer always teleports back to the given source node being personalized (rather than to a node chosen uniformly at random, as in the classic PageRank algorithm).</p>

  <p>That is, the random surfer in the personalized PageRank model works as follows:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>He starts at the source node $X$ that we want to calculate a personalized PageRank around.</li>
  <li>At step $i$: with probability $p$, the surfer moves to a neighboring node chosen uniformly at random; with probability $1-p$, the surfer instead teleports back to the original source node $X$.</li>
  <li>The limiting probability that the surfer is at node $N$ is then the personalized PageRank score of node $N$ around $X$.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Here&#8217;s some Scala code that computes approximate personalized PageRank scores and takes the highest-scoring nodes as the candidates to feed into the machine learning model:</p>

  <h2>Propagation Score</h2>

  <p>Another approach I used, based on <a href="http://www.kaggle.com/c/FacebookRecruiting/forums/t/2082/0-711-is-the-new-0">a proposal by another contestant on the Kaggle forums</a>, works as follows:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Start at a specified user node and give it some score.</li>
  <li>In the first iteration, this user propagates its score equally to its neighbors.</li>
  <li>In the second iteration, each user duplicates and keeps half of its score S. It then propagates S equally to its neighbors.</li>
  <li>In subsequent iterations, the process is repeated, except that neighbors reached via a backwards link don&#8217;t duplicate and keep half of their score. (The idea is that we want the score to reach followees and not followers.)</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Here&#8217;s some Scala code to calculate these propagation scores:</p>

  <p>I played around with tweaking some parameters in both approaches (e.g., weighting followers and followees differently), but the natural defaults (as used in the code above) ended up performing the best.</p>

  <h1>Features</h1>

  <p>After pruning the set of candidate destination nodes to a more feasible level, I fed pairs of (source, destination) nodes into a machine learning model. From each pair, I extracted around 30 features in total.</p>

  <p>As mentioned above, one feature that worked quite well on its own was whether the destination node already follows the source.</p>

  <p>I also used a wide set of similarity-based features, for example, the Jaccard similarity between the source and destination when both are represented as sets of their followers, when both are represented as sets of their followees, or when one is represented as a set of followers while the other is represented as a set of followees.</p>

  <p>Other features included the number of followers and followees of each node, the ratio of these, the personalized PageRank and propagation scores themselves, the number of followers in common, and triangle/closure-type features (e.g., whether the source node is friends with a node X who in turn is a friend of the destination node).</p>

  <p>If I had had more time, I would probably have tried weighted and more regularized versions of some of these features as well (e.g., downweighting nodes with large numbers of followers when computing cosine similarity scores based on followees, or shrinking the scores of nodes we have little information about).</p>

  <h1>Feature Understanding</h1>

  <p>But what are these features actually <em>doing</em>? Let&#8217;s use the same app I built before to take a look.</p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s the local network of node 317 (different from the node above), where each node is colored by its personalized PageRank (higher scores are in darker red):</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/0OpjUAK.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/0OpjUAK.png" alt="317 - Personalized PageRank" /></a></p>

  <p>If we look at the following vs. follower relationships of the central node (recall that purple is friends, teal is followings, orange is followers):</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IPWrww9.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/IPWrww9.png" alt="317 - Personalized PageRank" /></a></p>

  <p>&#8230;we can see that, as expected (because edges that represented both following and follower were double-weighted in my PageRank calculation), the darkest red nodes are those that are friends with the central node, while those in a following-only or follower-only relationship have a lower score.</p>

  <p>How does the propagation score compare to personalized PageRank? Here, I colored each node according to the log ratio of its propagation score and personalized PageRank:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/aenZaq6.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/aenZaq6.png" alt="317 - Log Ratio" /></a></p>

  <p>Comparing this coloring with the local follow/follower network:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/n6AZWyq.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/n6AZWyq.png" alt="317 - Local Network of Node" /></a></p>

  <p>&#8230;we can see that followed nodes (in teal) receive a higher propagation weight than friend nodes (in purple), while follower nodes (in orange) receive almost no propagation score at all.</p>

  <p>Going back to node 1, let&#8217;s look at a different metric. Here, each node is colored according to its Jaccard similarity with the source, when nodes are represented by the set of their followers:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hVnnFAO.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/hVnnFAO.png" alt="1 - Similarity by Followers" /></a></p>

  <p>We can see that, while the PageRank and propagation metrics tended to favor nodes <em>close</em> to the central node, the Jaccard similarity feature helps us explore nodes that are further out.</p>

  <p>However, if we look the high-scoring nodes more closely, we see that they often have only a single connection to the rest of the network:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/mRArIFf.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mRArIFf.png" alt="1 - Single Connection" /></a></p>

  <p>In other words, their high Jaccard similarity is due to the fact that they don&#8217;t have many connections to begin with. This suggests that some regularization or shrinking is in order.</p>

  <p>So here&#8217;s a regularized version of Jaccard similarity, where we downweight nodes with few connections:</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/1fZWX45.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/1fZWX45.png" alt="1 - Regularized" /></a></p>

  <p>We can see that the outlier nodes are much more muted this time around.</p>

  <p>For a starker difference, compare the following two graphs of the Jaccard similarity metric around node 317 (the first graph is an unregularized version, the second is regularized):</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/a7QWscH.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/a7QWscH.png" alt="317 - Unregularized" /></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/MPwk5Bv.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/MPwk5Bv.png" alt="317 - Regularized" /></a></p>

  <p>Notice, in particular, how the popular node in the top left and the popular nodes at the bottom have a much higher score when we regularize.</p>

  <p>And again, there are other networks and features I haven&#8217;t mentioned here, so play around and discover them on the <a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/">app</a> itself.</p>

  <h1>Models</h1>

  <p>For the machine learning algorithms on top of my features, I experimented with two types of models: logistic regression (using both L1 and L2 regularization) and random forests. (If I had more time, I would probably have done some more parameter tuning and maybe tried gradient boosted trees as well.)</p>

  <p>So what is a random forest? I wrote an <a href="http://www.quora.com/Random-Forests/How-do-random-forests-work-in-laymans-terms/answer/Edwin-Chen-1">old (layman&#8217;s) post</a> on it <a href="http://www.quora.com/Random-Forests/How-do-random-forests-work-in-laymans-terms/answer/Edwin-Chen-1">here</a>, but since nobody ever clicks on these links, let&#8217;s copy it over:</p>

  <blockquote><p>Suppose you&#8217;re very indecisive, so whenever you want to watch a movie, you ask your friend Willow if she thinks you&#8217;ll like it. In order to answer, Willow first needs to figure out what movies you like, so you give her a bunch of movies and tell her whether you liked each one or not (i.e., you give her a labeled training set). Then, when you ask her if she thinks you&#8217;ll like movie X or not, she plays a 20 questions-like game with IMDB, asking questions like &#8220;Is X a romantic movie?&#8221;, &#8220;Does Johnny Depp star in X?&#8221;, and so on. She asks more informative questions first (i.e., she maximizes the information gain of each question), and gives you a yes/no answer at the end.</p><p>    Thus, Willow is a decision tree for your movie preferences.</p><p>    But Willow is only human, so she doesn&#8217;t always generalize your preferences very well (i.e., she overfits). In order to get more accurate recommendations, you&#8217;d like to ask a bunch of your friends, and watch movie X if most of them say they think you&#8217;ll like it. That is, instead of asking only Willow, you want to ask Woody, Apple, and Cartman as well, and they vote on whether you&#8217;ll like a movie (i.e., you build an ensemble classifier, aka a forest in this case).</p><p>    Now you don&#8217;t want each of your friends to do the same thing and give you the same answer, so you first give each of them slightly different data. After all, you&#8217;re not absolutely sure of your preferences yourself &#8211; you told Willow you loved Titanic, but maybe you were just happy that day because it was your birthday, so maybe some of your friends shouldn&#8217;t use the fact that you liked Titanic in making their recommendations. Or maybe you told her you loved Cinderella, but actually you *really really* loved it, so some of your friends should give Cinderella more weight. So instead of giving your friends the same data you gave Willow, you give them slightly perturbed versions. You don&#8217;t change your love/hate decisions, you just say you love/hate some movies a little more or less (you give each of your friends a bootstrapped version of your original training data). For example, whereas you told Willow that you liked Black Swan and Harry Potter and disliked Avatar, you tell Woody that you liked Black Swan so much you watched it twice, you disliked Avatar, and don&#8217;t mention Harry Potter at all.</p><p>    By using this ensemble, you hope that while each of your friends gives somewhat idiosyncratic recommendations (Willow thinks you like vampire movies more than you do, Woody thinks you like Pixar movies, and Cartman thinks you just hate everything), the errors get canceled out in the majority. Thus, your friends now form a bagged (bootstrap aggregated) forest of your movie preferences.</p><p>    There&#8217;s still one problem with your data, however. While you loved both Titanic and Inception, it wasn&#8217;t because you like movies that star Leonardio DiCaprio. Maybe you liked both movies for other reasons. Thus, you don&#8217;t want your friends to all base their recommendations on whether Leo is in a movie or not. So when each friend asks IMDB a question, only a random subset of the possible questions is allowed (i.e., when you&#8217;re building a decision tree, at each node you use some randomness in selecting the attribute to split on, say by randomly selecting an attribute or by selecting an attribute from a random subset). This means your friends aren&#8217;t allowed to ask whether Leonardo DiCaprio is in the movie whenever they want. So whereas previously you injected randomness at the data level, by perturbing your movie preferences slightly, now you&#8217;re injecting randomness at the model level, by making your friends ask different questions at different times.</p><p>    And so your friends now form a random forest.</p></blockquote>


  <p>Moving on, I essentially trained <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>&#8217;s classifiers on an equal split of true and false edges (sampled from the output of my pruning step, in order to match the distribution I&#8217;d get when applying my algorithm to the official test set), and compared performance on the validation set I made, with a small amount of parameter tuning:</p>

  <p>So let&#8217;s look at the variable importance scores as determined by one of my random forest models, which (unsurprisingly) consistently outperformed logistic regression.</p>

  <p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/7D5yi6G.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/7D5yi6G.png" alt="Random Forest Importance Scores" /></a></p>

  <p>The random forest classifier here is one of my earlier models (using a slightly smaller subset of my full suite of features), where the targeting step consisted of taking the top 25 nodes with the highest propagation scores.</p>

  <p>We can see that the most important variables are:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Personalized PageRank scores. (I put in both normalized and unnormalized versions, where the normalized versions consisted of taking all the candidates for a particular source node, and scaling them so that the maximum personalized PageRank score was 1.)</li>
  <li>Whether the destination node already follows the source.</li>
  <li>How similar the source node is to the people the destination node is following, when each node is represented as a set of followers. (Note that this is more or less measuring how likely the destination is to follow the source, which we already saw is a good predictor of whether the source is likely to follow the destination.) Plus several variations on this theme (e.g., how similar the destination node is to the source node&#8217;s followers, when each node is represented as a set of followees).</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>Model Comparison</h1>

  <p>How do all of these models compare to each other? Is the random forest model universally better than the logistic regression model, or are there some sets of users for which the logistic regression model actually performs better?</p>

  <p>To enable these kinds of comparisons, I made <a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/comparison">a small module</a> that allows you to select two models and then visualize their sliced performance.</p>

  <p><a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/comparison"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ahNHp5z.png" alt="PageRank vs. Is Followed By" /></a></p>

  <p>(Go ahead, <a href="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/comparison">play around</a>.)</p>

  <p>Above, I bucketed all test nodes into buckets based on (the logarithm of) their number of followers, and compared the mean average precision of two algorithms: one that recommends nodes to follow using a personalized PageRank alone, and one that recommends nodes that are following the source user but are not followed back in return.</p>

  <p>We see that except for the case of 0 followers (where the &#8220;is followed by&#8221; algorithm can do nothing), the personalized PageRank algorithm gets increasingly better in comparison: at first, the two algorithms have roughly equal performance, but as the source node gets more followers, the personalized PageRank algorithm dominates.</p>

  <p>And here&#8217;s an embedded version you can interact with directly:</p>

  <iframe width="600px" height="500px" src="http://link-prediction.herokuapp.com/comparison?for_embed=true"></iframe>


  <p>Admittedly, building a slicer like this is probably overkill for a Kaggle competition, where the set of variables is fairly limited. But imagine having something similar for a real world model, where new algorithms are tried out every week and we can slice the performance by almost any dimension we can imagine (by geography, to make sure we don&#8217;t improve Australia at the expense of the UK; by user interests, to see where we could improve the performance of topic inference; by number of user logins, to make sure we don&#8217;t sacrifice the performance on new users for the gain of the core).</p>

  <h1>Mathematicians do it with Matrices</h1>

  <p>Let&#8217;s switch directions slightly and think about how we could rewrite our computations in a different, matrix-oriented style. (I didn&#8217;t do this in the competition &#8211; this is more a preview of another post I&#8217;m writing.)</p>

  <h2>Personalized PageRank in Scalding</h2>

  <p>Personalized PageRank, for example, is an obvious fit for a matrix rewrite. Here&#8217;s how it would look in <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2012/02/09/movie-recommendations-and-more-via-mapreduce-and-scalding/">Scalding</a>&#8217;s new Matrix library:</p>

  <p>(For those who don&#8217;t know, Scalding is a Hadoop framework that Twitter released at the beginning of the year; see <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2012/02/09/movie-recommendations-and-more-via-mapreduce-and-scalding/">my post on building a big data recommendation engine in Scalding</a> for an introduction.)</p>

  <p>Not only is this matrix formulation a more natural way of expressing the algorithm, but since Scalding (by way of Cascading) supports both local and distributed modes, this code runs just as easily on a Hadoop cluster of thousands of machines (assuming our social network is orders of magnitude larger than the one in the contest) as on a sample of data in a laptop. Big data, big matrix style, BOOM.</p>

  <h2>Cosine Similarity as L2-Normalized Multiplication</h2>

  <p>Here&#8217;s another example. Calculating cosine similarity between all users is a natural fit for a matrix formulation since, after all, the cosine similarity between two vectors is just their L2-normalized dot product:</p>

  <h2>A Similarity Extension</h2>

  <p>But let&#8217;s go one step further.</p>

  <p>To change examples for ease of exposition: suppose you&#8217;ve bought a bunch of books on Amazon, and Amazon wants to recommend a new book you&#8217;ll like. Since Amazon knows similarities between all pairs of books, one natural way to generate this recommendation is to:</p>

  <ol>
  <li>Take every book B.</li>
  <li>Calculate the similarity between B and each book you bought.</li>
  <li>Sum up all these similarities to get your recommendation score for B.</li>
  </ol>


  <p>In other words, the recommendation score for book B on user U is:</p>

  <p>DidUserBuy(U, Book 1) * SimilarityBetween(Book B, Book 1) + DidUserBuy(U, Book 2) * SimilarityBetween(Book B, Book2) + &#8230; + DidUserBuy(U, Book n) * SimilarityBetween(Book B, Book n)</p>

  <p>This, too, is a dot product! So it can also be rewritten as a matrix multiplication:</p>

  </span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div>


  <p>Of course, there&#8217;s a natural analogy between this score and the feature I described a while back above, where I compute a similarity score between a destination node and a source node&#8217;s followees (when all nodes are represented as sets of followers):</p>

  <p>For people comfortable expressing their computations in a vector manner, writing your computations as matrix manipulations often makes experimenting with different algorithms much more fluid. Imagine, for example, that you want to switch from L1 normalization to L2 normalization, or that you want to express your objects as binary sets rather than weighted vectors. Both of these become simple one-line changes when you have vectors and matrices as first-class objects, but are much more tedious (<em>especially in a MapReduce land where this matrix library was designed to be applied!</em>) when you don&#8217;t.</p>

  <h1>Finish Line</h1>

  <p>By now, I think I&#8217;ve spent more time writing this post than on the contest itself, so let&#8217;s wrap up.</p>

  <p>I often get asked what kinds of tools I like to use, so for this competition my kit consisted of:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Scala, for code that needed to be fast (e.g., extracting features) or that I was going to run repeatedly (e.g., scoring my validation set).</li>
  <li>Python, for my machine learning models, because <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a> is awesome.</li>
  <li>Ruby, for quick one-off scripts.</li>
  <li>R, for some data analysis and simple plotting.</li>
  <li>Coffeescript and d3, for the interactive visualizations.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Finally, I put up a <a href="https://github.com/echen/link-prediction">Github repository</a> containing some code, and here are a couple other posts I&#8217;ve written that people who like this entry might also enjoy:</p>
