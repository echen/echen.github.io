  <div class="entry-content"><p>Imagine you have a sequence of snapshots from a day in Justin Bieber&#8217;s life, and you want to label each image with the activity it represents (eating, sleeping, driving, etc.). How can you do this?</p>

  <p>One way is to ignore the sequential nature of the snapshots, and build a <em>per-image</em> classifier. For example, given a month&#8217;s worth of labeled snapshots, you might learn that dark images taken at 6am tend to be about sleeping, images with lots of bright colors tend to be about dancing, images of cars are about driving, and so on.</p>

  <p>By ignoring this sequential aspect, however, you lose a lot of information. For example, what happens if you see a close-up picture of a mouth &#8211; is it about singing or eating? If you know that the <em>previous</em> image is a picture of Justin Bieber eating or cooking, then it&#8217;s more likely this picture is about eating; if, however, the previous image contains Justin Bieber singing or dancing, then this one probably shows him singing as well.</p>

  <p>Thus, to increase the accuracy of our labeler, we should incorporate the labels of nearby photos, and this is precisely what a <strong>conditional random field</strong> does.</p>

  <h1>Part-of-Speech Tagging</h1>

  <p>Let&#8217;s go into some more detail, using the more common example of <strong>part-of-speech tagging</strong>.</p>

  <p>In POS tagging, the goal is to label a sentence (a sequence of words or tokens) with tags like ADJECTIVE, NOUN, PREPOSITION, VERB, ADVERB, ARTICLE.</p>

  <p>For example, given the sentence &#8220;Bob drank coffee at Starbucks&#8221;, the labeling might be &#8220;Bob (NOUN) drank (VERB) coffee (NOUN) at (PREPOSITION) Starbucks (NOUN)&#8221;.</p>

  <p>So let&#8217;s build a conditional random field to label sentences with their parts of speech. Just like any classifier, we&#8217;ll first need to decide on a set of feature functions $f_i$.</p>

  <h2>Feature Functions in a CRF</h2>

  <p>In a CRF, each <strong>feature function</strong> is a function that takes in as input:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>a sentence s</li>
  <li>the position i of a word in the sentence</li>
  <li>the label $l_i$ of the current word</li>
  <li>the label $l_{i-1}$ of the previous word</li>
  </ul>


  <p>and outputs a real-valued number (though the numbers are often just either 0 or 1).</p>

  <p>(Note: by restricting our features to depend on only the <em>current</em> and <em>previous</em> labels, rather than arbitrary labels throughout the sentence, I&#8217;m actually building the special case of a <strong>linear-chain CRF</strong>. For simplicity, I&#8217;m going to ignore general CRFs in this post.)</p>

  <p>For example, one possible feature function could measure how much we suspect that the current word should be labeled as an adjective given that the previous word is &#8220;very&#8221;.</p>

  <h2>Features to Probabilities</h2>

  <p>Next, assign each feature function $f_j$ a <strong>weight</strong> $\lambda_j$ (I&#8217;ll talk below about how to learn these weights from the data). Given a sentence s, we can now score a labeling l of s by adding up the weighted features over all words in the sentence:</p>

  <p>$score(l | s) = \sum_{j = 1}^m \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_j f_j(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1})$</p>

  <p>(The first sum runs over each feature function $j$, and the inner sum runs over each position $i$ of the sentence.)</p>

  <p>Finally, we can transform these scores into probabilities $p(l | s)$ between 0 and 1 by exponentiating and normalizing:</p>

  <p>$p(l | s) = \frac{exp[score(l|s)]}{\sum_{l&#8217;} exp[score(l&#8217;|s)]} = \frac{exp[\sum_{j = 1}^m \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_j f_j(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1})]}{\sum_{l&#8217;} exp[\sum_{j = 1}^m \sum_{i = 1}^n \lambda_j f_j(s, i, l&#8217;_i, l&#8217;_{i-1})]}$</p>

  <h2>Example Feature Functions</h2>

  <p>So what do these feature functions look like? Examples of POS tagging features could include:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>$f_1(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1}) = 1$ if $l_i =$ ADVERB and the ith word ends in &#8220;-ly&#8221;; 0 otherwise.

  <ul>
  <li>If the weight $\lambda_1$ associated with this feature is large and positive, then this feature is essentially saying that we prefer labelings where words ending in -ly get labeled as ADVERB.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>$f_2(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1}) = 1$ if $i = 1$, $l_i =$ VERB, and the sentence ends in a question mark; 0 otherwise.

  <ul>
  <li>Again, if the weight $\lambda_2$ associated with this feature is large and positive, then labelings that assign VERB to the first word in a question (e.g., &#8220;Is this a sentence beginning with a verb?&#8221;) are preferred.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>$f_3(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1}) = 1$ if $l_{i-1} =$ ADJECTIVE and $l_i =$ NOUN; 0 otherwise.

  <ul>
  <li>Again, a positive weight for this feature means that adjectives tend to be followed by nouns.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>$f_4(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1}) = 1$ if $l_{i-1} =$ PREPOSITION and $l_i =$ PREPOSITION.

  <ul>
  <li>A <em>negative</em> weight $\lambda_4$ for this function would mean that prepositions don&#8217;t tend to follow prepositions, so we should avoid labelings where this happens.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>


  <p>And that&#8217;s it! To sum up: to build a conditional random field, you just define a bunch of feature functions (which can depend on the entire sentence, a current position, and nearby labels), assign them weights, and add them all together, transforming at the end to a probability if necessary.</p>

  <p>Now let&#8217;s step back and compare CRFs to some other common machine learning techniques.</p>

  <h1>Smells like Logistic Regression&#8230;</h1>

  <p>The form of the CRF probabilities
  $p(l | s) = \frac{exp[\sum_{j = 1}^m \sum_{i = 1}^n f_j(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1})]}{\sum_{l&#8217;} exp[\sum_{j = 1}^m \sum_{i = 1}^n f_j(s, i, l&#8217;_i, l&#8217;_{i-1})]}$
  might look <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">familiar</a>.</p>

  <p>That&#8217;s because CRFs are indeed basically the sequential version of <strong>logistic regression</strong>: whereas logistic regression is a log-linear model for <em>classification</em>, CRFs are a log-linear model for <em>sequential labels</em>.</p>

  <h1>Looks like HMMs&#8230;</h1>

  <p>Recall that <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model">Hidden Markov Models</a></strong> are another model for part-of-speech tagging (and sequential labeling in general). Whereas CRFs throw any bunch of functions together to get a label score, HMMs take a <em>generative</em> approach to labeling, defining</p>

  <p>$p(l,s) = p(l_1) \prod_i p(l_i | l_{i-1}) p(w_i | l_i)$</p>

  <p>where</p>

  <ul>
  <li>$p(l_i | l_{i-1})$ are <strong>transition</strong> probabilities (e.g., the probability that a preposition is followed by a noun);</li>
  <li>$p(w_i | l_i)$ are <strong>emission</strong> probabilities (e.g., the probability that a noun emits the word &#8220;dad&#8221;).</li>
  </ul>


  <p>So how do HMMs compare to CRFs? CRFs are more powerful &#8211; they can model everything HMMs can and more. One way of seeing this is as follows.</p>

  <p>Note that the log of the HMM probability is $\log p(l,s) = \log p(l_0) + \sum_i \log p(l_i | l_{i-1}) + \sum_i \log p(w_i | l_i)$. This has exactly the log-linear form of a CRF if we consider these log-probabilities to be the weights associated to binary transition and emission indicator features.</p>

  <p>That is, we can build a CRF equivalent to any HMM by&#8230;</p>

  <ul>
  <li>For each HMM <em>transition</em> probability $ p(l_i = y | l_{i-1} = x) $, define a set of CRF transition features of the form $f_{x,y}(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1}) = 1$ if $l_i = y$ and $l_{i-1} = x$. Give each feature a weight of $w_{x,y} = \log p(l_i = y | l_{i-1} = x)$.</li>
  <li>Similarly, for each HMM <em>emission</em> probability $p(w_i = z | l_{i} = x)$, define a set of CRF emission features of the form $g_{x,y}(s, i, l_i, l_{i-1}) = 1$ if $w_i = z$ and $l_i = x$. Give each feature a weight of $w_{x,z} = \log p(w_i = z | l_i = x)$.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Thus, the score $p(l|s)$ computed by a CRF using these feature functions is precisely proportional to the score computed by the associated HMM, and so every HMM is equivalent to some CRF.</p>

  <p>However, CRFs can model a much richer set of label distributions as well, for two main reasons:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>CRFs can define a much larger set of features.</strong> Whereas HMMs are necessarily <em>local</em> in nature (because they&#8217;re constrained to binary transition and emission feature functions, which force each word to depend only on the current label and each label to depend only on the previous label), CRFs can use more <em>global</em> features. For example, one of the features in our POS tagger above increased the probability of labelings that tagged the <em>first</em> word of a sentence as a VERB if the <em>end</em> of the sentence contained a question mark.</li>
  <li><strong>CRFs can have arbitrary weights.</strong> Whereas the probabilities of an HMM must satisfy certain constraints (e.g., $0 &lt;= p(w_i | l_i) &lt;= 1, \sum_w p(w_i = w | l_1) = 1)$, the weights of a CRF are unrestricted (e.g., $\log p(w_i | l_i)$ can be anything it wants).</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>Learning Weights</h1>

  <p>Let&#8217;s go back to the question of how to learn the feature weights in a CRF. One way is (surprise) to use <strong>gradient ascent</strong>.</p>

  <p>Assume we have a bunch of training examples (sentences and associated part-of-speech labels). Randomly initialize the weights of our CRF model.
  To shift these randomly initialized weights to the correct ones, for each training example&#8230;</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Go through each feature function $f_i$, and calculate the gradient of the log probability of the training example with respect to $\lambda_i$: $\frac{\partial}{\partial w_j} \log p(l | s) = \sum_{j = 1}^m f_i(s, j, l_j, l_{j-1}) - \sum_{l&#8217;} p(l&#8217; | s) \sum_{j = 1}^m f_i(s, j, l&#8217;_j, l&#8217;_{j-1})$</li>
  <li>Note that the first term in the gradient is the contribution of feature $f_i$ under the <em>true</em> label, and the second term in the gradient is the <em>expected</em> contribution of feature $f_i$ under the current model. This is exactly the form you&#8217;d expect gradient ascent to take.</li>
  <li>Move $\lambda_i$ in the direction of the gradient: $\lambda_i = \lambda_i + \alpha [\sum_{j = 1}^m f_i(s, j, l_j, l_{j-1}) - \sum_{l&#8217;} p(l&#8217; | s) \sum_{j = 1}^m f_i(s, j, l&#8217;_j, l&#8217;_{j-1})]$ where $\alpha$ is some learning rate.</li>
  <li>Repeat the previous steps until some stopping condition is reached (e.g., the updates fall below some threshold).</li>
  </ul>


  <p>In other words, every step takes the difference between what we want the model to learn and the model&#8217;s current state, and moves $\lambda_i$ in the direction of this difference.</p>

  <h1>Finding the Optimal Labeling</h1>

  <p>Suppose we&#8217;ve trained our CRF model, and now a new sentence comes in. How do we do label it?</p>

  <p>The naive way is to calculate $p(l | s)$ for every possible labeling l, and then choose the label that maximizes this probability. However, since there are $k^m$ possible labels for a tag set of size k and a sentence of length m, this approach would have to check an exponential number of labels.</p>

  <p>A better way is to realize that (linear-chain) CRFs satisfy an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_substructure">optimal substructure</a> property that allows us to use a (polynomial-time) dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal label, similar to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm">Viterbi algorithm</a> for HMMs.</p>

  <h1>A More Interesting Application</h1>

  <p>Okay, so part-of-speech tagging is kind of boring, and there are plenty of existing POS taggers out there. When might you use a CRF in real life?</p>

  <p>Suppose you want to mine Twitter for the types of presents people received for Christmas:</p>

  <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>What people on Twitter wanted for Christmas, and what they got: <a href="http://t.co/EGeKTBgF" title="http://twitter.com/edchedch/status/153683967315419136/photo/1">twitter.com/edchedch/statu…</a></p>— Edwin Chen (@edchedch) <a href="https://twitter.com/edchedch/status/153683967315419136" data-datetime="2012-01-02T03:48:10+00:00">January 2, 2012</a></blockquote>


  <script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


  <p>(Yes, I just embedded a tweet. BOOM.)</p>

  <p>How can you figure out which words refer to gifts?</p>

  <p>To gather data for the graphs above, I simply looked for phrases of the form &#8220;I want XXX for Christmas&#8221; and &#8220;I got XXX for Christmas&#8221;. However, a more sophisticated CRF variant could use a GIFT part-of-speech-like tag (even adding other tags like GIFT-GIVER and GIFT-RECEIVER, to get even more information on who got what from whom) and treat this like a POS tagging problem. Features could be based around things like &#8220;this word is a GIFT if the previous word was a GIFT-RECEIVER and the word before that was &#8216;gave&#8217;&#8221; or &#8220;this word is a GIFT if the next two words are &#8216;for Christmas&#8217;&#8221;.</p>

  <h1>Fin</h1>

  <p>I&#8217;ll end with some more random thoughts:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>I explicitly skipped over the graphical models framework that conditional random fields sit in, because I don&#8217;t think they add much to an initial understanding of CRFs. But if you&#8217;re interested in learning more, Daphne Koller is teaching a free, online course on <a href="http://www.pgm-class.org/">graphical models</a> starting in January.</li>
  <li>Or, if you&#8217;re more interested in the many NLP applications of CRFs (like part-of-speech tagging or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition">named entity extraction</a>), Manning and Jurafsky are teaching an <a href="http://www.nlp-class.org/">NLP class</a> in the same spirit.</li>
  <li>I also glossed a bit over the analogy between CRFs:HMMs and Logistic Regression:Naive Bayes. This image (from <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.4088v1">Sutton and McCallum&#8217;s introduction to conditional random fields</a>) sums it up, and shows the graphical model nature of CRFs as well:</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize">Netflix Prize</a> won? I went through a lot of the Netflix Prize papers a couple years ago, so I&#8217;ll try to give an overview of the techniques that went into the winning solution here.</p>

  <h1>Normalization of Global Effects</h1>

  <p>Suppose Alice rates Inception 4 stars. We can think of this rating as composed of several parts:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>A <strong>baseline rating</strong> (e.g., maybe the mean over all user-movie ratings is 3.1 stars).</li>
  <li>An <strong>Alice-specific effect</strong> (e.g., maybe Alice tends to rate movies lower than the average user, so her ratings are -0.5 stars lower than we normally expect).</li>
  <li>An <strong>Inception-specific effect</strong> (e.g., Inception is a pretty awesome movie, so its ratings are 0.7 stars higher than we normally expect).</li>
  <li>A less predictable effect based on the <strong>specific interaction</strong> between Alice and Inception that accounts for the remainder of the stars (e.g., Alice really liked Inception because of its particular combination of Leonardo DiCaprio and neuroscience, so this rating gets an additional 0.7 stars).</li>
  </ul>


  <p>In other words, we&#8217;ve decomposed the 4-star rating into:
  4 = [3.1 (the baseline rating) - 0.5 (the Alice effect) + 0.7 (the Inception effect)] + 0.7 (the specific interaction)</p>

  <p>So instead of having our models predict the 4-star rating itself, we could first try to remove the effect of the baseline predictors (the first three components) and have them predict the specific 0.7 stars. (I guess you can also think of this as a simple kind of boosting.)</p>

  <p>More generally, additional baseline predictors include:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>A factor that allows Alice&#8217;s rating to (linearly) depend on the (square root of the) <strong>number of days since her first rating</strong>. (For example, have you ever noticed that you become a harsher critic over time?)</li>
  <li>A factor that allows Alice&#8217;s rating to depend on the <strong>number of days since the movie&#8217;s first rating by anyone</strong>. (If you&#8217;re one of the first people to watch it, maybe it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re a huge fan and really excited to see it on DVD, so you&#8217;ll tend to rate it higher.)</li>
  <li>A factor that allows Alice&#8217;s rating to depend on the <strong>number of people who have rated Inception</strong>. (Maybe Alice is a hipster who hates being part of the crowd.)</li>
  <li>A factor that allows Alice&#8217;s rating to <strong>depend on the movie&#8217;s overall rating</strong>.</li>
  <li>(Plus a bunch of others.)</li>
  </ul>


  <p>And, in fact, modeling these biases turned out to be fairly important: in their paper describing their final solution to the Netflix Prize, Bell and Koren write that</p>

  <blockquote><p>Of the numerous new algorithmic contributions, I would like to highlight one &#8211; those humble baseline predictors (or biases), which capture main effects in the data. While the literature mostly concentrates on the more sophisticated algorithmic aspects, we have learned that an accurate treatment of main effects is probably at least as signficant as coming up with modeling breakthroughs.</p></blockquote>


  <p>(For a perhaps more concrete example of why removing these biases is useful, suppose you know that Bob likes the same kinds of movies that Alice does. To predict Bob&#8217;s rating of Inception, instead of simply predicting the same 4 stars that Alice rated, if we know that Bob tends to rate movies 0.3 stars higher than average, then we could first remove Alice&#8217;s bias and then add in Bob&#8217;s: 4 + 0.5 + 0.3 = 4.8.)</p>

  <h1>Neighborhood Models</h1>

  <p>Let&#8217;s now look at some slightly more sophisticated models. As alluded to in the section above, one of the standard approaches to collaborative filtering is to use neighborhood models.</p>

  <p>Briefly, a neighborhood model works as follows. To predict Alice&#8217;s rating of Titanic, you could do two things:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Item-item approach</strong>: find a set of items similar to Titanic that Alice has also rated, and take the (weighted) mean of Alice&#8217;s ratings on them.</li>
  <li><strong>User-user approach</strong>: find a set of users similar to Alice who rated Titanic, and again take the mean of their ratings of Titanic.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>(See also my post on <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/02/15/an-overview-of-item-to-item-collaborative-filtering-with-amazons-recommendation-system/">item-to-item collaborative filtering on Amazon</a>.)</p>

  <p>The main questions, then, are (let&#8217;s stick to the item-item approach for simplicity):</p>

  <ul>
  <li>How do we find the set of similar items?</li>
  <li>How do we weight these items when taking their mean?</li>
  </ul>


  <p>The standard approach is to take some similarity metric (e.g., correlation or a Jaccard index) to define similarities between pairs of movies, take the K most similar movies under this metric (where K is perhaps chosen via cross-validation), and then use the same similarity metric when computing the weighted mean.</p>

  <p>This has a couple problems:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Neighbors aren&#8217;t independent</strong>, so using a standard similarity metric to define a weighted mean overcounts information. For example, suppose you ask five friends where you should eat tonight. Three of them went to Mexico last week and are sick of burritos, so they strongly recommend against a taqueria. Thus, your friends&#8217; recommendations have a stronger bias than what you&#8217;d get if you asked five friends who didn&#8217;t know each other at all. (Compare with the situation where all three Lord of the Rings Movies are neighbors of Harry Potter.)</li>
  <li>Different movies should perhaps be using <strong>different numbers of neighbors</strong>. Some movies may be predicted well by only one neighbor (e.g., Harry Potter 2 could be predicted well by Harry Potter 1 alone), some movies may require more, and some movies may have no good neighbors (so you should ignore your neighborhood algorithms entirely and let your other ratings models stand on their own).</li>
  </ul>


  <p>So another approach is the following:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>You can still use a similarity metric like correlation or cosine similarity to choose the set of similar items.</li>
  <li>But instead of using the similarity metric to define the interpolation weights in the mean calculations, you essentially perform a (sparse) <strong>linear regression to find the weights</strong> that minimize the squared error between an item&#8217;s rating and a linear combination of the ratings of its neighbors. Note that these weights are no longer constrained, so that if all neighbors are weak, then their weights will be close to zero and the neighborhood model will have a low effect.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>(A slightly more complicated user-user approach, similar to this item-item neighborhood approach, is also useful.)</p>

  <h1>Implicit Data</h1>

  <p>Adding on to the neighborhood approach, we can also let <strong>implicit data influence our predictions</strong>. The mere fact that a user rated lots of science fiction movies but no westerns, suggests that the user likes science fiction better than cowboys. So using a similar framework as in the neighborhood ratings model, we can learn for Inception a set of <strong>offset weights</strong> associated to Inception&#8217;s movie neighbors.</p>

  <p>Whenever we want to predict how Bob rates Inception, we look at whether Bob rated each of Inception&#8217;s neighbors. If he did, we add in the corresponding offset; if not, then we add nothing (and, thus, Bob&#8217;s rating is implicitly penalized by the missing weight).</p>

  <h1>Matrix Factorization</h1>

  <p>Complementing the neighborhood approach to collaborative filtering is the matrix factorization approach. Whereas the neighborhood approach takes a very local approach to ratings (if you liked Harry Potter 1, then you&#8217;ll like Harry Potter 2!), the factorization approach takes a more global view (we know that you like fantasy movies and that Harry Potter has a strong fantasy element, so we think that you&#8217;ll like Harry Potter) that <strong>decomposes users and movies into a set of latent factors</strong> (which we can think of as categories like &#8220;fantasy&#8221; or &#8220;violence&#8221;).</p>

  <p>In fact, matrix factorization methods were probably the most important class of techniques for winning the Netflix Prize. In their 2008 Progress Prize paper, Bell and Koren write</p>

  <blockquote><p>It seems that models based on matrix-factorization were found to be most accurate (and thus popular), as evident by recent publications and discussions on the Netflix Prize forum. We definitely agree to that, and would like to add that those matrix-factorization models also offer the important flexibility needed for modeling temporal effects and the binary view. Nonetheless, neighborhood models, which have been dominating most of the collaborative filtering literature, are still expected to be popular due to their practical characteristics - being able to handle new users/ratings without re-training and offering direct explanations to the recommendations.</p></blockquote>


  <p>The typical way to perform matrix factorizations is to perform a <strong>singular value decomposition</strong> on the (sparse) ratings matrix (using stochastic gradient descent and regularizing the weights of the factors, possibly constraining the weights to be positive to get a type of non-negative matrix factorization). (Note that this &#8220;SVD&#8221; is a little different from the standard SVD learned in linear algebra, since not every user has rated every movie and so the ratings matrix contains many missing elements that we don&#8217;t want to simply treat as 0.)</p>

  <p>Some SVD-inspired methods used in the Netflix Prize include:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Standard SVD</strong>: Once you&#8217;ve represented users and movies as factor vectors, you can dot product Alice&#8217;s vector with Inception&#8217;s vector to get Alice&#8217;s predicted rating of Inception.</li>
  <li><strong>Asymmetric SVD</strong>: Instead of users having their own notion of factor vectors, we can represent users as a bag of items they have rated (or provided implicit feedback for). So Alice is now represented as a (possibly weighted) sum of the factor vectors of the items she has rated, and to get her predicted rating of Titanic, we can dot product this  representation with the factor vector of Titanic. From a practical perspective, this model has an added benefit in that no user parameterizations are needed, so we can use this approach to generate recommendations as soon as a user provides some feedback (which could just be views or clicks on an item, and not necessarily ratings), without needing to retrain the model to factorize the user.</li>
  <li><strong>SVD++</strong>: Incorporate both the standard SVD and the asymmetric SVD model by representing users both by their own factor representation and as a bag of item vectors.</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>Regression</h1>

  <p>Some regression models were also used in the predictions. The models are fairly standard, I think, so I won&#8217;t spend too long here. Basically, just as with the neighborhood models, we can take a user-centric approach and a movie-centric approach to regression:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>User-centric approach</strong>: We learn a regression model for each user, using all the movies that the user rated as the dataset. The response is the movie&#8217;s rating, and the predictor variables are attributes associated to that movie (which can be derived from, say, PCA, MDS, or an SVD).</li>
  <li><strong>Movie-centric approach</strong>: Similarly, we can learn a regression model for each movie, using all the users that rated the movie as the dataset.</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>Restricted Boltzmann Machines</h1>

  <p>Restricted Boltzmann Machines provide another kind of <strong>latent factor approach</strong> that can be used. See <a href="http://www.machinelearning.org/proceedings/icml2007/papers/407.pdf">this paper</a> for a description of how to apply them to the Netflix Prize. (In case the paper&#8217;s a little difficult to read, I wrote an <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/07/18/introduction-to-restricted-boltzmann-machines">introduction to RBMs</a> a little while ago.)</p>

  <h1>Temporal Effects</h1>

  <p>Many of the models incorporate temporal effects. For example, when describing the baseline predictors above, we used a few temporal predictors that allowed a user&#8217;s rating to (linearly) depend on the time since the first rating he ever made and on the time since a movie&#8217;s first rating. We can also get more fine-grained temporal effects by, say, binning items into a couple months&#8217; worth of ratings at a time, and allowing movie biases to change within each bin. (For example, maybe in May 2006, Time Magazine nominated Titanic as the best movie ever made, which caused a spurt in glowing ratings around that time.)</p>

  <p>In the matrix factorization approach, user factors were also allowed to be time-dependent (e.g., maybe Bob comes to like comedy movies more and more over time). We can also give more weight to recent user actions.</p>

  <h1>Regularization</h1>

  <p>Regularization was also applied throughout pretty much all the models learned, to <strong>prevent overfitting</strong> on the dataset. Ridge regression was heavily used in the factorization models to penalize large weights, and lasso regression (though less effective) was useful as well. Many other parameters (e.g., the baseline predictors, similarity weights and interpolation weights in the neighborhood models) were also estimated using fairly standard shrinkage techniques.</p>

  <h1>Ensemble Methods</h1>

  <p>Finally, let&#8217;s talk about how all of these different algorithms were combined to provide a single rating that <strong>exploits the strengths of each model</strong>. (Note that, as mentioned above, many of these models were not trained on the raw ratings data directly, but rather on the residuals of other models.)</p>

  <p>In the paper detailing their final solution, the winners describe using <strong>gradient boosted decision trees to combine over 500 models</strong>; previous solutions used instead a <strong>linear regression</strong> to combine the predictors.</p>

  <p>Briefly, gradient boosted decision trees work by sequentially fitting a series of decision trees to the data; each tree is asked to predict the error made by the previous trees, and is often trained on slightly perturbed versions of the data. (For a longer description of a similar technique, see <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/03/14/laymans-introduction-to-random-forests/">my introduction to random forests</a>.)</p>

  <p>Since GBDTs have a built-in ability to apply different methods to different slices of the data, we can add in some predictors that help the trees make useful clusterings:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Number of movies each user rated</li>
  <li>Number of users that rated each movie</li>
  <li>Factor vectors of users and movies</li>
  <li>Hidden units of a restricted Boltzmann Machine</li>
  </ul>


  <p>(For example, one thing that Bell and Koren found (when using an earlier ensemble method) was that RBMs are more useful when the movie or the user has a low number of ratings, and that matrix factorization methods are more useful when the movie or user has a high number of ratings.)</p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s a graph of the effect of ensemble size from early on in the competition (in 2007), and the authors&#8217; take on it:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/newensemble.gif"><img src="http://www2.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/newensemble.gif" alt="Ensemble Size vs. RMSE" /></a></p>

  <blockquote><p>However, we would like to stress that it is not necessary to have such a large number of models to do well. The plot below shows RMSE as a function of the number of methods used. One can achieve our winning score (RMSE=0.8712) with less than 50 methods, using the best 3 methods can yield RMSE < 0.8800, which would land in the top 10. Even just using our single best method puts us on the leaderboard with an RMSE of 0.8890. The lesson here is that having lots of models is useful for the incremental results needed to win competitions, but practically, excellent systems can be built with just a few well-selected models.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What types of students go to which schools? There are, of course, the classic stereotypes:</p>

  </ul>


  <p>What do we see?</p>

  <ul>
  <li>First, in a nice validation of this approach, we find that each school is interested in exactly the <strong>locations</strong> we&#8217;d expect: Caltech is interested in <em>Pasadena</em> and <em>Los Angeles</em>; MIT and Harvard are both interested in <em>Boston</em> and <em>Cambridge</em> (Harvard is interested in <em>New York City</em> as well); Stanford is interested in <em>Palo Alto</em>, <em>Northern California</em>, and <em>San Francisco Bay Area</em>; and Berkeley is interested in <em>Berkeley</em>, <em>San Francisco</em>, and <em>Mountain View</em>.</li>
  <li>More interestingly, let&#8217;s look at where each school likes to <strong>eat</strong>. Stereotypically, we expect Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley students to be more outgoing and social, and MIT and Caltech students to be more introverted. This is indeed what we find:

  <ul>
  <li>Harvard follows <em>Food in New York City</em>; Stanford follows <em>Food &amp; Restaurants in Palo Alto</em>, <em>Restaurants in San Francisco</em>, and <em>Food in San Francisco</em>; and Berkeley follows <em>Restaurants in San Francisco</em> and <em>In-N-Out Burger</em>. In other words, Harvard, Stanford, and Berkeley love eating out.</li>
  <li>Caltech, on the other hand, loves <em>Cooking</em>, and MIT loves <em>Healthy Eating</em> &#8211; both signs, perhaps, of a preference for eating in.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>And what does each university use to quench their <strong>thirst</strong>? Harvard students like to drink <em>wine</em> (classy!), while Stanford students prefer <em>beer</em> (the social drink of choice).</li>
  <li>What about <strong>sports teams</strong>? MIT and Caltech couldn&#8217;t care less, though Harvard follows the <em>Boston Red Sox</em>, Stanford follows the <em>San Francisco Giants</em> (as well as their own <em>Stanford Football</em> and <em>Stanford Cardinal</em>), and Berkeley follows the <em>Los Angeles Lakers</em> (and the <em>California Golden Bears</em>).</li>
  <li>For <strong>sports</strong> themselves, MIT students like <em>skiing</em>; Stanford students like <em>general exercise</em>, <em>fitness</em>, and <em>sports</em>; Harvard students like <em>baseball</em>, <em>ultimate frisbee</em>, and <em>skiing</em>; and Berkeley students like <em>snowboarding</em>. Caltech, in a league of its own, enjoys <em>table tennis</em> and <em>chess</em>.</li>
  <li>What does each school think of <strong>social</strong>? Caltech students look for Social <em>Advice</em>. Berkeley students are interested in Social <em>Media</em> and Social Media Marketing. MIT, on the more technical side, wants Social <em>Search</em>. Stanford students, predictably, love the whole spectrum of social offerings, from Social <em>Dance</em> and <em>The Social Network</em>, to Social <em>Psychology</em> and Social <em>Advice</em>. (Interestingly, Caltech and Stanford are both interested in Social Advice, though I wonder if it&#8217;s for slightly different reasons.)</li>
  <li>What&#8217;s each school&#8217;s relationship with <strong>computers</strong>? Caltech students are interested in Computer <em>Science</em>, MIT hackers are interested in Computer <em>Security</em>, and Stanford students are interested in Human-Computer <em>Interaction</em>.</li>
  <li>Digging into the <strong>MIT vs. Caltech</strong> divide a little, we see that Caltech students really are more interested in the pure sciences (<em>Physics, Science, Biology, Quantum Mechanics, Mathematics, Chemistry</em>, etc.), while MIT students are more on the applied and engineering sides (<em>Mechanical Engineering, Engineering, Distributed Databases, Cryptography, Computer Security, Biotechnology, Operating Systems, Compilers</em>, etc.).</li>
  <li>Regarding <strong>programming languages</strong>, Caltech students love <em>Haskell</em> (hardcore purity!), while MIT students love <em>Lisp</em>.</li>
  <li>What does each school like to <strong>read</strong>, both offline and online? Caltech loves <em>science fiction</em>, <em>xkcd</em>, and <em>The Onion</em>; MIT likes <em>Hacker News</em>; Harvard loves journals, newspapers, and magazines (<em>Huffington Post</em>, the <em><a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/01/31/45-the-sunday-new-york-times/">New York Times</a></em>, <em>Fortune, Wall Street Journal, the New Yorker, the Economist</em>, and so on); and Stanford likes <em>TechMeme</em>.</li>
  <li>What <strong>movies and television shows</strong> does each school like to watch? Caltech likes <em>Star Trek</em>, the <em>Colbert Report</em>, and <em>Futurama</em>. MIT likes <em>Fight Club</em> (I don&#8217;t know what this has to do with MIT, though I will note that on my first day as a freshman in a new dorm, Fight Club was precisely the movie we all went to a lecture hall to see). Stanford likes <em>The Social Network</em> and <em>Inception</em>. Harvard, rather fittingly, likes <em><a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2009/03/11/123-mad-men/">Mad Men</a></em> and <em><a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2010/09/08/134-the-ted-conference/">Ted Talks</a></em>.</li>
  <li>Let&#8217;s look at the <strong>startups</strong> each school follows. MIT, of course, likes <em>Ksplice</em>. Berkeley likes <em>Yelp</em> and <em>Groupon</em>. Stanford likes just about every startup under the sun (<em>Instagram, Flipboard, Tumblr, Path, Color Labs</em>, etc.). And Harvard, that bastion of hard-won influence and prestige? To the surprise of precisely no one, Harvard enjoys <em>Klout</em>.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Let&#8217;s end with a summarized view of each school:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Caltech</strong> is very much into the sciences (<em>Physics, Biology, Quantum Mechanics, Mathematics</em>, etc.), as well as many pretty nerdy topics (<em>Star Trek, Science Fiction, xkcd, Futurama, Starcraft II</em>, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>MIT</strong> is dominated by everything engineering and tech.</li>
  <li><strong>Stanford</strong> loves relationships (<em>interpersonal relationships, people skills, love, network effects, sex, etiquette, dating and relationships, romance</em>), health and appearance (<em>fashion, fitness, nutrition, happiness</em>), and startups (<em>Instagram, Flipboard, Path, Color Labs</em>, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Berkeley</strong>, sadly, is perhaps too large and diverse for an overall characterization.</li>
  <li><strong>Harvard</strong> students are fascinated by famous figures (<em>Jimmy Fallon, Oprah Winfrey, Invaka Trump, Dalai Lama, David Lynch, Al Gore, Bill Gates, Barack Obama</em>), and by prestigious newspapers, journals, and magazines (<em>Fortune, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Economist</em>, and so on). Other very fitting interests include <em><a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/01/21/12-non-profit-organizations/">Kiva</a>, <a href="http://stuffwhitepeoplelike.com/2008/09/01/108-appearing-to-enjoy-classical-music/">classical music</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2008/06/coldplay">Coldplay</a></em>.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>*I pulled about 400 followers from each school, and added a couple filters, to try to ensure that followers were actual attendees of the schools rather than general people simply interested in them. Topics are sorted using a naive Bayes score and filtered to have at least 5 counts. Also, a word of warning: my dataset was fairly small and users on Quora are almost certainly not representative of their schools as a whole (though I tried to be rigorous with what I had).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ4Ntg4jQHw">this movie visualization</a> for a case study on how a post propagates through Quora.</p>

  <p>How does information spread through a network? Much of Quora&#8217;s appeal, after all, lies in its social graph &#8211; and when you&#8217;ve got a network of users, all broadcasting their activities to their neighbors, information can cascade in multiple ways. How do these social designs affect which users see what?</p>

  <p>Think, for example, of what happens when your kid learns a new slang word at school. He doesn&#8217;t confine his use of the word to McKinley Elementary&#8217;s particular boundaries, between the times of 9-3pm &#8211; he introduces it to his friends from other schools at soccer practice as well. A couple months later, he even says it at home for the first time; you like the word so much, you then start using it at work. Eventually, Justin Bieber uses the word in a song, at which point the word&#8217;s popularity really starts to explode.</p>

  <p>So how does information propagate through a social network? What types of people does an answer on Quora reach, and how does it reach them? (Do users discover new answers individually, or are hubs of connectors more key?) How does the activity of a post on Quora rise and fall? (Submissions on other sites have limited lifetimes, fading into obscurity soon after an initial spike; how does that change when users are connected and every upvote can revive a post for someone else&#8217;s eyes?)</p>

  <p>(I looked at Quora since I had some data from there already available, but I hope the lessons should be fairly applicable in general, to other social networks like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn as well.)</p>

  <p>To give an initial answer to some of these questions, I dug into one of my more popular posts, on <a href="http://www.quora.com/Random-Forests/How-do-random-forests-work-in-laymans-terms">a layman&#8217;s introduction to random forests</a>.</p>

  <h1>Users, Topics</h1>

  <p>Before looking deeper into the voting dynamics of the post, let&#8217;s first get some background on what kinds of users the answer reached.</p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s a graph of the topics that question upvoters follow. (Each node is a topic, and every time upvoter X follows both topics A and B, I add an edge between A and B.)</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-unlabeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-unlabeled.png" alt="Upvoters' Topics - Unlabeled" /></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-labeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoter-topics-labeled.png" alt="Upvoters' Topics - Labeled" /></a></p>

  <p>We can see from the graph that upvoters tend to be interested in three kinds of topics:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Machine learning and other technical matters</strong> (the green cluster): Classification, Data Mining, Big Data, Information Retrieval, Analytics, Probability, Support Vector Machines, R, Data Science, &#8230;</li>
  <li><strong>Startups/Silicon Valley</strong> (the red cluster): Facebook, Lean Startups, Investing, Seed Funding, Angel Investing, Technology Trends, Product Managment, Silicon Valley Mergers and Acquisitions, Asana, Social Games, Quora, Mark Zuckerberg, User Experience, Founders and Entrepreneurs, &#8230;</li>
  <li><strong>General Intellectual Topics</strong> (the purple cluster): TED, Science, Book Recommendations, Philosophy, Politics, Self-Improvement, Travel, Life Hacks, &#8230;</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Also, here&#8217;s the network of the upvoters themselves (there&#8217;s an edge between users A and B if A follows B):</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-unlabeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-unlabeled.png" alt="Upvote Network - Unlabeled" /></a></p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-labeled.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/rf-upvoters-labeled.png" alt="Upvote Network - Labeled" /></a></p>

  <p>We can see three main clusters of users:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>A large group in <strong>green</strong> centered around a lot of power users and Quora employees.</li>
  <li>A machine learning group of folks in <strong>orange</strong> centered around people like Oliver Grisel, Christian Langreiter, and Joseph Turian.</li>
  <li>A group of people following me, in <strong>purple</strong>.</li>
  <li>Plus some smaller clusters in blue and yellow. (There were also a bunch of isolated users, connected to no one, that I filtered out of the picture.)</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Digging into how these topic and user graphs are related:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>The orange cluster of users is more heavily into machine learning: 79% of users in that cluster follow more green topics (machine learning and technical topics) than red and purple topics (startups and general intellectual matters).</li>
  <li>The green cluster of users is reversed: 77% of users follow more of the red and purple clusters of topics (on startups and general intellectual matters) than machine learning and technical topics.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>More interestingly, though, we can ask: how do the connections between upvoters relate to the way the post spread?</p>

  <h1>Social Voting Dynamics</h1>

  <p>So let&#8217;s take a look. Here&#8217;s a visualization I made of upvotes on my answer across time (click <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ4Ntg4jQHw">here</a> for a larger view).</p>

  <iframe width="640" height="510" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/cZ4Ntg4jQHw " frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


  <p></p>

  <p>To represent the social dynamics of these upvotes, I drew an edge from user A to user B if user A transmitted the post to user B through an upvote. (Specifically, I drew an edge from Alice to Bob if Bob follows Alice and Bob&#8217;s upvote appeared within five days of Alice&#8217;s upvote; this is meant to simulate the idea that Alice was the key intermediary between my post and Bob.)</p>

  <p>Also,</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Green nodes are users with at least one upvote edge.</li>
  <li>Blue nodes are users who follow at least one of the topics the post is categorized under (i.e., users who probably discovered the answer by themselves).</li>
  <li>Red nodes are users with no connections and who do not follow any of the post&#8217;s topics (i.e, users whose path to the post remain mysterious).</li>
  <li>Users increase in size when they produce more connections.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Here&#8217;s a play-by-play of the video:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>On Feb 14 (the day I wrote the answer), there&#8217;s a flurry of activity.</li>
  <li>A couple of days later, Tracy Chou gives an upvote, leading to another spike in activity.</li>
  <li>Then all&#8217;s quiet until&#8230; bam! Alex Kamil leads to a surge of upvotes, and his upvote finds Ludi Rehak, who starts a small surge of her own. They&#8217;re quickly followed by Christian Langreiter, who starts a small revolution among a bunch of machine learning folks a couple days later.</li>
  <li>Then all is pretty calm again, until a couple months later when&#8230; bam! Aditya Sengupta brings in a smashing of his own followers, and his upvote makes its way to Marc Bodnick, who sets off a veritable storm of activity.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>(Already we can see some relationships between the graph of user connections and the way the post propagated. Many of the users from the orange cluster, for example, come from Alex Kamil and Christian Langreiter&#8217;s upvotes, and many of the users from the green cluster come from Aditya Sengupta and Marc Bodnick&#8217;s upvotes. What&#8217;s interesting, though, is, why didn&#8217;t the cluster of green users appear all at once, like the orange cluster did? People like Kah Seng Tay, Tracy Chou, Venkatesh Rao, and Chad Little upvoted the answer pretty early on, but it wasn&#8217;t until Aditya Sengupta&#8217;s upvote a couple months later that people like Marc Bodnick, Edmond Lau, and many of the other green users (who do indeed follow that first set of folks) discovered the answer. Did the post simply get lost in users&#8217; feeds the first time around? Was the post perhaps ignored until it received enough upvotes to be considered worth reading? Are some users&#8217; upvotes just trusted more than others&#8217;?)</p>

  <p>For another view of the upvote dynamics, here&#8217;s a static visualization, where we can again easily see the clusters of activity:</p>

  <p><a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/upvote-clusters-labeled-v2.png"><img src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/10506/blog/social-network-transmission/upvote-clusters-labeled-v2.png" alt="Upvote Temporal Clusters" /></a></p>

  <h1>Fin</h1>

  <p>There are still many questions it would be interesting to look at; for example,</p>

  <ul>
  <li>What differentiates users who sparked spikes of activity from users who didn&#8217;t? I don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s simply number of followers, as many well-connected upvoters did <em>not</em> lead to cascades of shares. Does authority matter?</li>
  <li>How far can a post reach? Clearly, the post reached people more than one degree of separation away from me (where one degree of separation is a follower); what does the distribution of degrees look like? Is there any relationship between degree of separation and time of upvote?</li>
  <li>What can we say about the people who started following me after reading my answer? Are they fewer degrees of separation away? Are they more interested in machine learning? Have they upvoted any of my answers before? (Perhaps there&#8217;s a certain &#8220;threshold&#8221; of interestingness people need to overflow before they&#8217;re considered acceptable followees.)</li>
  </ul>


  <p>But to summarize a bit what we&#8217;ve seen so far, here are some statistics on the role the social graph played in spreading the post:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>There are 5 clusters of activity after the initial post, sparked both by power users and less-connected folks. In an interesting cascade of information, some of these sparks led to further spikes in activity as well (as when Aditya Sengupta&#8217;s upvote found its way to Marc Bodnick, who set off even more activity).</li>
  <li>35% of users made their way to my answer because of someone else&#8217;s upvote.</li>
  <li>Through these connections, the post reached a fair variety of users: 32% of upvoters don&#8217;t even follow any of the post&#8217;s topics.</li>
  <li>77% of upvotes came from users over two weeks <em>after</em> my answer appeared.</li>
  <li>If we look only at the upvoters who follow at least one of the post&#8217;s topics, 33% didn&#8217;t see my answer until someone else showed it to them. In other words, a full one-third of people who presumably would have been interested in my post anyways only found it because of their social network.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>So it looks like the social graph played quite a large part in the post&#8217;s propagation, and I&#8217;ll end with a big shoutout to Stormy Shippy, who provided an awesome set of scripts I used to collect a lot of this data.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Suppose you have the following set of sentences:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>I like to eat broccoli and bananas.</li>
  <li>I ate a banana and spinach smoothie for breakfast.</li>
  <li>Chinchillas and kittens are cute.</li>
  <li>My sister adopted a kitten yesterday.</li>
  <li>Look at this cute hamster munching on a piece of broccoli.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>What is latent Dirichlet allocation? It&#8217;s a way of automatically discovering <strong>topics</strong> that these sentences contain. For example, given these sentences and asked for 2 topics, LDA might produce something like</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Sentences 1 and 2</strong>: 100% Topic A</li>
  <li><strong>Sentences 3 and 4</strong>: 100% Topic B</li>
  <li><strong>Sentence 5</strong>: 60% Topic A, 40% Topic B</li>
  <li><strong>Topic A</strong>: 30% broccoli, 15% bananas, 10% breakfast, 10% munching, &#8230; (at which point, you could interpret topic A to be about food)</li>
  <li><strong>Topic B</strong>: 20% chinchillas, 20% kittens, 20% cute, 15% hamster, &#8230; (at which point, you could interpret topic B to be about cute animals)</li>
  </ul>


  <p>The question, of course, is: how does LDA perform this discovery?</p>

  <h1>LDA Model</h1>

  <p>In more detail, LDA represents documents as <strong>mixtures of topics</strong> that spit out words with certain probabilities. It assumes that documents are produced in the following fashion: when writing each document, you</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Decide on the number of words N the document will have (say, according to a Poisson distribution).</li>
  <li>Choose a topic mixture for the document (according to a Dirichlet distribution over a fixed set of K topics). For example, assuming that we have the two food and cute animal topics above, you might choose the document to consist of 1/3 food and 2/3 cute animals.</li>
  <li>Generate each word w_i in the document by:

  <ul>
  <li>First picking a topic (according to the multinomial distribution that you sampled above; for example, you might pick the food topic with 1/3 probability and the cute animals topic with 2/3 probability).</li>
  <li>Using the topic to generate the word itself (according to the topic&#8217;s multinomial distribution). For example, if we selected the food topic, we might generate the word &#8220;broccoli&#8221; with 30% probability, &#8220;bananas&#8221; with 15% probability, and so on.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>


  <p>Assuming this generative model for a collection of documents, LDA then tries to backtrack from the documents to find a set of topics that are likely to have generated the collection.</p>

  <h2>Example</h2>

  <p>Let&#8217;s make an example. According to the above process, when generating some particular document D, you might</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Pick 5 to be the number of words in D.</li>
  <li>Decide that D will be 1/2 about food and 1/2 about cute animals.</li>
  <li>Pick the first word to come from the food topic, which then gives you the word &#8220;broccoli&#8221;.</li>
  <li>Pick the second word to come from the cute animals topic, which gives you &#8220;panda&#8221;.</li>
  <li>Pick the third word to come from the cute animals topic, giving you &#8220;adorable&#8221;.</li>
  <li>Pick the fourth word to come from the food topic, giving you &#8220;cherries&#8221;.</li>
  <li>Pick the fifth word to come from the food topic, giving you &#8220;eating&#8221;.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>So the document generated under the LDA model will be &#8220;broccoli panda adorable cherries eating&#8221; (note that LDA is a bag-of-words model).</p>

  <h1>Learning</h1>

  <p>So now suppose you have a set of documents. You&#8217;ve chosen some fixed number of K topics to discover, and want to use LDA to learn the topic representation of each document and the words associated to each topic. How do you do this? One way (known as collapsed Gibbs sampling) is the following:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Go through each document, and randomly assign each word in the document to one of the K topics.</li>
  <li>Notice that this random assignment already gives you both topic representations of all the documents and word distributions of all the topics (albeit not very good ones).</li>
  <li>So to improve on them, for each document d&#8230;

  <ul>
  <li>Go through each word w in d&#8230;

  <ul>
  <li>And for each topic t, compute two things: 1) p(topic t | document d) = the proportion of words in document d that are currently assigned to topic t, and 2) p(word w | topic t) = the proportion of assignments to topic t over all documents that come from this word w. Reassign w a new topic, where we choose topic t with probability p(topic t | document d) * p(word w | topic t) (according to our generative model, this is essentially the probability that topic t generated word w, so it makes sense that we resample the current word&#8217;s topic with this probability). (Also, I&#8217;m glossing over a couple of things here, in particular the use of priors/pseudocounts in these probabilities.)</li>
  <li>In other words, in this step, we&#8217;re assuming that all topic assignments except for the current word in question are correct, and then updating the assignment of the current word using our model of how documents are generated.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>After repeating the previous step a large number of times, you&#8217;ll eventually reach a roughly steady state where your assignments are pretty good. So use these assignments to estimate the topic mixtures of each document (by counting the proportion of words assigned to each topic within that document) and the words associated to each topic (by counting the proportion of words assigned to each topic overall).</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>Layman&#8217;s Explanation</h1>

  <p>In case the discussion above was a little eye-glazing, here&#8217;s another way to look at LDA in a different domain.</p>

  <p>Suppose you&#8217;ve just moved to a new city. You&#8217;re a hipster and an anime fan, so you want to know where the other hipsters and anime geeks tend to hang out. Of course, as a hipster, you know you can&#8217;t just <em>ask</em>, so what do you do?</p>

  <p>Here&#8217;s the scenario: you scope out a bunch of different establishments (<strong>documents</strong>) across town, making note of the people (<strong>words</strong>) hanging out in each of them (e.g., Alice hangs out at the mall and at the park, Bob hangs out at the movie theater and the park, and so on). Crucially, you don&#8217;t know the typical interest groups (<strong>topics</strong>) of each establishment, nor do you know the different interests of each person.</p>

  <p>So you pick some number K of categories to learn (i.e., you want to learn the K most important kinds of categories people fall into), and start by making a guess as to why you see people where you do. For example, you initially guess that Alice is at the mall because people with interests in X like to hang out there; when you see her at the park, you guess it&#8217;s because her friends with interests in Y like to hang out there; when you see Bob at the movie theater, you randomly guess it&#8217;s because the Z people in this city really like to watch movies; and so on.</p>

  <p>Of course, your random guesses are very likely to be incorrect (they&#8217;re random guesses, after all!), so you want to improve on them. One way of doing so is to:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Pick a place and a person (e.g., Alice at the mall).</li>
  <li>Why is Alice likely to be at the mall? Probably because other people at the mall with the same interests sent her a message telling her to come.</li>
  <li>In other words, the more people with interests in X there are at the mall and the stronger Alice is associated with interest X (at all the other places she goes to), the more likely it is that Alice is at the mall because of interest X.</li>
  <li>So make a new guess as to why Alice is at the mall, choosing an interest with some probability according to how likely you think it is.</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Go through each place and person over and over again. Your guesses keep getting better and better (after all, if you notice that lots of geeks hang out at the bookstore, and you suspect that Alice is pretty geeky herself, then it&#8217;s a good bet that Alice is at the bookstore because her geek friends told her to go there; and now that you have a better idea of why Alice is probably at the bookstore, you can use this knowledge in turn to improve your guesses as to why everyone else is where they are), and eventually you can stop updating. Then take a snapshot (or multiple snapshots) of your guesses, and use it to get all the information you want:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>For each category, you can count the people assigned to that category to figure out what people have this particular interest. By looking at the people themselves, you can interpret the category as well (e.g., if category X contains lots of tall people wearing jerseys and carrying around basketballs, you might interpret X as the &#8220;basketball players&#8221; group).</li>
  <li>For each place P and interest category C, you can compute the proportions of people at P because of C (under the current set of assignments), and these give you a representation of P. For example, you might learn that the people who hang out at Barnes &amp; Noble consist of 10% hipsters, 50% anime fans, 10% jocks, and 30% college students.</li>
  </ul>


  <h1>Real-World Example</h1>

  <p>Finally, I applied LDA to a set of Sarah Palin&#8217;s emails a little while ago (see <a href="http://blog.echen.me/2011/06/27/topic-modeling-the-sarah-palin-emails/">here</a> for the blog post, or <a href="http://sarah-palin.heroku.com/">here</a> for an app that allows you to browse through the emails by the LDA-learned categories), so let&#8217;s give a brief recap. Here are some of the topics that the algorithm learned:</p>

  <ul>
  <li><strong>Trig/Family/Inspiration</strong>: family, web, mail, god, son, from, congratulations, children, life, child, down, trig, baby, birth, love, you, syndrome, very, special, bless, old, husband, years, thank, best, &#8230;</li>
  <li><strong>Wildlife/BP Corrosion</strong>: game, fish, moose, wildlife, hunting, bears, polar, bear, subsistence, management, area, board, hunt, wolves, control, department, year, use, wolf, habitat, hunters, caribou, program, denby, fishing, &#8230;</li>
  <li><strong>Energy/Fuel/Oil/Mining:</strong> energy, fuel, costs, oil, alaskans, prices, cost, nome, now, high, being, home, public, power, mine, crisis, price, resource, need, community, fairbanks, rebate, use, mining, villages, &#8230;</li>
  <li><strong>Gas</strong>: gas, oil, pipeline, agia, project, natural, north, producers, companies, tax, company, energy, development, slope, production, resources, line, gasline, transcanada, said, billion, plan, administration, million, industry, &#8230;</li>
  <li><strong>Education/Waste</strong>: school, waste, education, students, schools, million, read, email, market, policy, student, year, high, news, states, program, first, report, business, management, bulletin, information, reports, 2008, quarter, &#8230;</li>
  <li><strong>Presidential Campaign/Elections</strong>: mail, web, from, thank, you, box, mccain, sarah, very, good, great, john, hope, president, sincerely, wasilla, work, keep, make, add, family, republican, support, doing, p.o, &#8230;</li>
  </ul>


  <p>Here&#8217;s an example of an email which fell 99% into the Trig/Family/Inspiration category (particularly representative words are highlighted in blue):</p>

  <p>And here&#8217;s an excerpt from an email which fell 10% into the Presidential Campaign/Election category (in red) and 90% into the Wildlife/BP Corrosion category (in green):</p>
